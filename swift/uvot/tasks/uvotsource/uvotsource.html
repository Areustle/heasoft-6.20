<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
     This tool performs aperture photometry on a single source in a
UVOT SKY exposure (sw*.img+extension).  It returns information about
the count rate from the source, the source's magnitude, and flux
density information.
</p>

<p>
     The user specifies the source extraction region and background
region using region files that are in the standard ftool or ds9
format.  Region files must use the fk5 coordinate system.  The RA
and Dec coordinates can be specified in either decimal degrees or
in sexagisemal format.  Examples of a valid source region file and
a valid background region file are give below.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Example Source Region File</dt>
  <dd>fk5;circle(12:34:56.78,76:54:32.1,2.5&quot;)</dd>

  <dt>Example Background Region File</dt>
  <dd>fk5;circle(123.456,-78.987,12&quot;)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
     If &quot;srcreg&quot; is set to NONE then the tool will return
the &quot;sigma&quot;-sigma limiting magnitude for the exposure
instead of a source magnitude.  The &quot;sigma&quot; parameter tells
the tool what level of significance to use to compute the background
limit.  Photometric and coincidence loss calibration data are read
from the files specified by &quot;zerofile&quot; and
&quot;coinfile&quot; respectively.  If a large-scale sensitivity map
is available it can be specified using &quot;lssfile&quot;.  The
special value CALDB tells the tool to obtain calibration data from the
Swift/UVOT calibration database.  The user must have the $CALDB
environment variable correctly set to use this option.  If
&quot;apercorr&quot; is set to CURVEOFGROWTH the PSF data is read from
&quot;psffile&quot;.  The &quot;psffile&quot; is not used if
&quot;apercorr=NONE&quot;.  If &quot;frametime&quot; is set to DEFAULT
the frame time is read from the image header.  In some cases this
keyword may not be present in the FITS file, so a value can be
specified by the user.
</p>

<p>
     There is currently one option for doing photometry.  The tool does
simple aperture photometry.  All of the counts in the &quot;srcreg&quot;
region are summed and divided by the exposure time to produce a count
rate.  The background count rate is subtracted and the magnitude is
computed from the coincidence-corrected net count rate.  Photometry is
done as follows.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Extract the raw counts in three apertures.
    <ol>
      <li>The user-supplied source region, &quot;srcreg&quot;.

      <p>
           The source aperture may be any size or shape that can be
      described in a valid region file.  The source region should be
      selected to maximize the science return.  In general faint point
      sources should use circular apertures with a radius that
      maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio in the aperture.  This is
      typically about 3 arcsec.  For bright sources the standard
      photometric aperture (defined in &quot;zerofile&quot;) is
      usually preferred.  The source aperture should be chosen to
      minimize contamination from other sources.
      </p></li>

      <li>The user-supplied background region, &quot;bkgreg&quot;.

      <p>
           The background region may be any size or shape that can be
      described in a valid region file.  It should be chosen to have
      the same background properties as the source region.  It should
      be free of contaminating sources and large enough so that the
      mean pixel value is not biased by Poisson statistics.  The
      background value is computed by taking the mean of the pixel
      values in the background region.
      </p></li>

      <li>A coincidence-loss correction aperture, defined in
          &quot;coinfile&quot;

      <p>
           This region is a circular aperture with an radius defined
      by the COIAPT column in the COINCIDENCE extension of the
      &quot;coinfile&quot; file.  It is centred on the centre of the
      &quot;srcreg&quot; region.  This is the region that is used to
      compute the coincidence loss correction factor.
      </p></li>
    </ol>

      <p>
           Counts are extracted from the input exposure by the XImage
      &quot;counts&quot; command.  See the XImage User's Guide for
      details on how counts are extracted.
      </p></li>

  <li>Calculate the coincidence loss correction factor from the count
      rate in the coincidence-loss correction aperture.  See the fhelp
      for uvotcoincidence for details about coincidence-loss
      corrections.</li>

  <li>Apply the coincidence-loss factor to the raw count rate in the
      source aperture.</li>

  <li>Scale the background count rate to the area of the
      coincidence-loss aperture and then apply the coincidence loss
      factor.</li>

  <li>Scale the coincidence-corrected background rate to the area of
      the user-supplied source aperture and subtract this from the
      coincidence-corrected rate in the source aperture to get the
      coincidence-corrected net count rate from the source.</li>

  <li><p>
      If &quot;apercorr=NONE&quot; then no aperture corrections are
      performed.  In order to perform aperture corrections to convert
      the measured magnitude to the standard UVOT system use
      &quot;apercorr=CURVEOFGROWTH&quot;.  This option does aperture
      photometry as described above with one additional step: an
      estimated aperture correction is applied to the
      coincidence-corrected net count rate from the source.
      </p>

      <p>
      <em>Uvotsource will only return magnitudes and flux densities
      that are on the standard UVOT photometric
      system <strong>if</strong> the source region is the same as the
      standard photometric aperture defined in
      &quot;zerofile&quot;.</em>  If a different aperture ratius is
      used then one can bring these magnitudes onto the standard
      system using &quot;apercorr=CURVEOFGROWTH&quot;, which computes an
      aperture correction to the coincidence-loss corrected net count
      rate from the source.  See the fhelp for uvotapercorr for
      details on aperture corrections and how they are applied.  Be
      aware that &quot;apercorr=CURVEOFGROWTH&quot; assumes that the
      source is a point source.
      </p>

      <p>
      Uvotsource adds a systematic uncertainty to the error in the
      aperture-corrected net count rate that accounts for the
      uncertainty in the shape of the UVOT PSF.  See the discussion of
      the &quot;fwhmsig&quot; parameter in the fhelp for uvotapercorr
      for a discussion of this.  The version of uvotsource that was
      released with HEADAS 6.4 (Swift_Rel2.8(BLD22)_19Nov2007, use the
      swiftversion command to check which version of uvotsource you
      are using) does not allow the user to set this number.  A value
      of 5% is used.  The value of &quot;fwhmsig&quot; does not affect
      the value of the aperture correction, only the error in the
      aperture correction.
      </p>

      <p>
      Magnitudes derived from a smaller-than-standard aperture will
      have smaller statistical errors than magnitudes derived using
      the standard aperture.  This is because the smaller aperture
      contains less background and is more dominated by light from the
      source.  However, the trade-off is that the smaller-aperture
      magnitudes, because of the need for aperture correction, will
      have an extra systematic component to their errors that is not
      present in the standard aperture magnitudes.  Users need to
      weigh the trade-off between these two sources of error when
      deciding on whether or not to use
      &quot;apercorr=CURVEOFGROWTH&quot;.
      </p></li>

  <li>If a large-scale sensitivity map is specified using
      &quot;lssfile&quot; then a large-scale sensitivity correction is
      applied to the count rate from the source.  If
      &quot;lssfile=NONE&quot; then no large-scale sensitivity
      correction is applied.  See the fhelp page for uvotlss for more
      details.</li>

  <li>If a detector sensitivity calibration file is specified using
      &quot;sensfile&quot; then a detector sensitivity correction is
      applied to the count rate from the source.  If
      &quot;sensfile=NONE&quot; then no detector sensitivity
      correction is applied.</li>

  <li>Apply the photometric calibrations from &quot;zerofile&quot; to
      the net count rate from the source, after all of the corrections
      have been applied, to obtain the magnitude and flux density
      information described below.  Note that the photometric
      calibrations assume that the source region is the same as the
      standard photometric aperture, so the values returned
      will <strong>not</strong> be on the standard UVOT photometric
      system if some other aperture region is used.  See the
      description of the CURVEOFGROWTH aperture correction for details
      on how to correct for this.</li>
</ol>

<p>
     The aperture correction applied by CURVEOFGROWTH is approximate
and is intended for preliminary data analysis.  It does not take into
account changes in the PSF due to temperature or count rate variations
(see the uvotapercorr fhelp).  For high-precision photometry
&quot;apercorr=NONE&quot;should be used, and aperture corrections that
take these factors into account should be performed by the user.

<dd>Large-scale sensitivity correction file which can take several forms.
    FITS file syntax for an HDU having UVOT LSS calibration format.
    The special value CALDB indicates to read from the calibration data base.
    The special value NONE indicates to skip this correction.
    A value SKY:&lt;fitsname&gt; indicates a sky LSS map (as produced by uvotskylss).
    </dd>

<dt>(sensfile = CALDB) [string]</dt>
<dd>Detector sensitivity loss correction file.
	The special value CALDB indicates to read from the calibration data base.
	The special value NONE indicates to skip this correction.
	</dd>

<dt>(expfile = NONE) [string]</dt>
<dd>Exposure map file or NONE.
    If an exposure map is provided, the tool will ensure that the source
    and background regions are within the FOV.  Output will only be generated
    if all pixels in the regions are exposed.  It is not required that every
    pixel have the same exposure or does not have a NULL value.</dd>

<dt>(syserr = no) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Are systematic errors in the photometric calibration to be used in
    the error calculations.  If set to YES then systematic errors are
    added in quadrature to the statistical errors.  If set to NO then
    only statistical errors are returned.</dd>

<dt>(frametime = DEFAULT) [float]</dt>
<dd>The frame time, in seconds, for the exposure.  If DEFAULT is
    specified then &quot;frametime&quot; is read from the image
    header.</dd>

<dt>(apercorr = CURVEOFGROWTH) [string]</dt>
<dd>Aperture correction calculation algorithm.  NONE or CURVEOFGROWTH.
    CURVEOFGROWTH assumes a point source.</dd>

<dt>(fwhmsig = -1) [real]</dt>
<dd>Percentage uncertainty in FWHM of PSF. See uvotapercorr fwhmsig parameter.
    This parameter is only used if apercorr=CURVEOFGROWTH.</dd>

<dt>(output = ALL) [string]</dt>
<dd>Output sections specified using a comma separated list.
	The options are instrumental filter magnitude (MAG),
    flux density in erg/s/cm^2/Angstrom (FLUX), corrected count rate
    in counts/s (RATE), raw count rate in counts/s (RAW), flux density
    in milliJanskys (FLUXJ).  The special value ALL indicates that all
    sections are to be output.</dd>

<dt>outfile [string]</dt>
<dd>Output FITS file to append results to.  Uvotsource will create a
    new file if the specified file does not exist.  The special value
    NONE indicates to not create an output file.</dd>

<dt>(centroid = no) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Centroid source position?  If true, the source position will be centroided
based on srcreg.  The resulting centroid position will be reported, written to
the RA and DEC columns, and used as the center of the circular region used for
coincidence loss correction.
Only use centroid=yes if srcreg contains a single shape because only the first
shape (recentered on the centroid) will be used to arrive at SRC_AREA and RAW_TOT_COUNTS.</dd>

<dt>(deadtimecorr = yes) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Was the exposure time of the input already dead time corrected?
</dt>

<dt>(extprec = 0) [integer]</dt>
<dd>Extra digits of precision to display in terminal output.
    </dd>

<dt>(subpixel = 8) [integer]</dt>
<dd>Sub-pixelling level.  Each input pixel is divided along each axis by this factor.  For example, with subpixel=8, each 2-dimensional input pixel is divided into 64=8*8 subpixels).
    </dd>

<dt>(cleanup = yes) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Standard HEAdas cleanup parameter; controls whether temporary
    files are removed at the end of processing.</dt>

<dt>(clobber = no) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Standard HEAdas clobber parameter; controls whether to overwrite
    pre-existing output files.</dd>

<dt>(chatter = 1) [enumerated integer]</dt>
<dd>Standard HEAdas chatter parameter (1-5) controlling the verbosity
    of the task.</dd>

</dl>


<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>
The following examples illustrate running uvotsource
</p>

<p>
1. run uvotsource prompting for all mandatory options:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
      uvotsource
</pre>

</p>

<p>
2. run uvotsource specifying many arguments explicitly
</p>

<p>
<pre>
      uvotsource image=sky.img.gz+1 srcreg=src.reg bkgreg=bkg.reg sigma=5 zerofile=CALDB coinfile=CALDB psffile=CALDB lssfile=CALDB syserr=NO frametime=DEFAULT apercorr=NONE output=ALL outfile=sources.fits cleanup=YES clobber=NO chatter=1
</pre>
</p>

<p>
3. run uvotsource with the curve of growth aperture corrections and include
   systematic errors:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
      uvotsource image=sky.img.gz+1 srcreg=src.reg bkgreg=bkg.reg sigma=5 syserr=YES apercorr=CURVEOFGROWTH outfile=sources.fits
</pre>
</p>
