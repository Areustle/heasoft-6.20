<h2>NAME</h2>
uvotimggen - create a multi-extensioned fits image file for each uvot
filter from a singe fits image and a observing sequence text file. 

<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>
uvotimggen infile extfile obsid starttime Btime Brawx Brawy rate0 
 clobber history chatter mode
</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
This program takes a image file as a seed and generate several multi
extensioned fits file based on input from a observing sequence text
file.  (One fits file will be created for each uvot filter.)
uvotimggen will allow the user to 
<ul>
<li>specify an fits image</li>
<li>specify an observing sequence to generate images for </li>
</ul>


<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>

<dl>
<dt>infile [filename]
<dd>Image file to use a seed to generate other images from 

<dt>extlist [filename]
<dd>obserbing sequence table in text file format

<dt>obsid [string]
<dd>An observation id used to create the output file names 

<dt>starttime [integer]
<dd>number of seconds after the burst the first image occurs

<dt>Btime [string]
<dd>The time you want the burst to occur 

<dt>Brawx [integer]
<dd>raw x coordinates of burst

<dt>Brawy [integer]
<dd>raw y coordinates of burst

<dt>(clobber = no) [boolean]
<dd>If outfile already exists, then "clobber = yes" will overwrite it.

<dt>(history = no) [boolean]
<dd>If history = yes, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written
to the header of the output file to record the value of all the ftcopy
task parameters that were used to produce the output file.

<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer, 0 - 5]
<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard output.
Setting chatter = 5 will produce detailed diagnostic output, otherwise
this task normally does not write any output.

<dt>(mode = ql) [string, ql|h]
<dd>If mode = ql then .
If mode = h then .
</dl>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>
Note that when commands are issued on the Unix command line, strings
containing special characters such as '[' or ']' must be enclosed in
single or double quotes.

<p>
The following example is a typical uvotimggen run. 

<p>
<pre>
uvotimggen "INPUT.FIT" "OBSERVE.LIST" "012345678001" 10 default 1024 1024 0.5 
</pre>
<p>
Where INPUT.FIT is the name of a fits image to use as a seed.
OBSERVE.LIST is a text table containing observing sequences, and
INPUT.FIT is the name of a fits image to use as a seed.
<ul>
<li>012345678001 is an observation id
<li>10 is the number of seconds after the burst the first image generated will occur
<li>default is the time the burst will occur (get from the input image file)
<li>1024 raw x coordinate of burst
<li>1024 raw y coordinate of burst
<li>0.5 is the intensity of the burst image
</ul>


<p>Alternatively the user could just run uvotimggen and be prompted for the
inputs
