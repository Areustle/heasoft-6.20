<h2>NAME</h2>

uvotmodmap - correct images for modulo-8 spatial fixed-pattern noise

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>uvotmodmap infile badpixfile outfile
</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
This tool takes an image file and matching quality image (bad pixel
map) in order to correct the modulo-8 spatial fixed pattern noise. The
tool outputs a corrected image file and optionally a map of the
corrections. The quality image is expected to match the image file in
number of extensions and dimensions of each image.
<p>
The final stage of the UVOT detector is a 256 by 256 pixel
CCD. Individual events are centroided to one eighth of a physical CCD
detector pixel by the onboard electronics. However, the centroiding
algorithm distributes the photons unevenly within each physical CCD
pixel, corresponding to 8 by 8 image pixels or a single mod-8 tile.
<p>
The tool first steps a box of size ncell across the image, and within
the box a sigma clipping algorithm is used to mask out sources more
significant than nsig and any surrounding pixels affected by
coincidence loss. Then the average of all remaining mod-8 tiles within
a sliding box of size ncell is computed and used to produce the mod-8
map.
<p>
The algorithm resamples the image to give each image pixel equal area
within a mod-8 tile. For each mod-8 tile in the mod-8 map, the pixel
x-boundaries are determined such that within each row of pixels the
counts/unit pixel area is the same for each pixel. This is then taken
as the spatial layout of the pixel x-boundaries in the same mod-8 tile
in the science image and the science image is resampled to a grid of
evenly spaced pixels. Then the y-boundaries of each row are determined
such that each row has the same number of counts/unit pixel area. This
is then taken as the spatial layout of pixel y-boundaries in the same
mod-8 tile in the science image, which is then resampled to a grid of
evenly spaced rows.  The same procedure is then repeated with the
order reversed (remapping in y followed by remapping in x) and the
final corrected science image is made from an average of the two
resamplings. This is to ensure that the redistribution of photons is
performed in an identical fashion in x and y.

</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Here is a typical uvotmodmap run:
<p>
<pre>
      uvotmodmap infile=input.fits badpixfile=quality.fits outfile=output.fits
</pre>

<p>
Alternatively, you could just run uvotmodmap and be prompted for the inputs.
