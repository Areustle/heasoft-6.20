<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
     The Swift/UVOT photometry aperture used to derive the photometric
zero points is a circle of radius 5 arcsec (see Poole et al. 2008,
MNRAS, 383, p627 for details).  This aperture contains approximately
85% of the photons from a point source, and keeps background
contamination to a reasonable level.  It is large enough to smooth out
the ubiquitous modulo-8 fixed-pattern image noise which results from
the electronic oversampling of UVOT detector pixels.  In cases where
UVOT point sources are faint and approach the background-limited
detection threshold, it is desirable to perform source detection using
smaller apertures.  While making the aperture radius smaller than 5
arcsec increases the signal-to-noise, and consequently the detection
probability, the drawback is that counts within the wings of the
source point-spread function (PSF) are ignored and the brightness of
the source underestimated.  Uvotapercorr is a tool to calculate and
add the neglected photons within the PSF wings to small-aperture count
rates so that magnitude conversions can be performed accurately.
</p>

<p>
     The method adopted in this tool is a quick-and-dirty approach
with a number of critical caveats which are discussed below. The mean
PSFs for each broadband filter are characterized as encircling energy
functions in tables within the Swift/UVOT CALDB; see
$CALDB/data/swift/uvota/cpf/psf/ and the release note at
<http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/caldb/swift/docs/uvot/>.
The <i>U</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>V</i> PSFs are all similar in form and
width. The UVW1, UVM2 and UVW2 PSFs are generally narrower in the core
with broader wings compared to the optical filters.  The PSFs are
employed to extrapolate count rates measured within a small aperture
to count rates predicted from within the 5 arcsec aperture used to
derive the photometric zero points. This is achieved cheaply by a
linear interpolation of the PSF table, which provides the fraction of
total energy within the user-provided circular aperture radius,
&quot;aperad&quot;.  The fraction is a simple scaling quantity which
is applied to both the user-supplied count rate, &quot;cntrate&quot;
and count rate uncertainty, &quot;raterr&quot; in order to provide an
aperture-corrected count rate.
</p>

<p>
     This procedure is a useful approximation if the extraction
aperture is circular and centered precisely on the centroid of the
PSF.  Any deviation from these criteria will yield unquantified
systematic errors.
</p>

<p>
     There are systematic problems to be aware of.  The full-width at
half-maximum (FWHM) of the PSF is dependent on the temperature of the
UVOT focusing rods.  Their temperature varies slightly with time
because the voltage on the heaters changes through the spacecraft
orbit.  This can cause variations in the shape of the PSF.  Currently
this variation has not been well-characterized. Until this occurs it
remains the user's responsibility to add a systematic uncertainty to
the width of the PSF which is propagated into the corrected count rate
uncertainty. Current functionality assumes that the form of the PSF is
constant over time, i.e., the ratio of counts in the line core and
line wings remains constant, but the width of the entire profile is
scaled by a variable quantity during a sequence of exposures. The PSFs
characterized in the Swift/UVOT CALDB are considered to be 'typical'.
</p>

<p>
     To characterize the systematic uncertainty added by variable PSFs
to the corrected count rate, the user provides an argument,
&quot;fwhmsig&quot;, which estimates the fractional rms variation of
the FWHM of point sources.  The appropriate value for
&quot;fwhmsig&quot; is under investigation.  At present the UVOT team
recommends 15% based on fitting Gaussians to observed UVOT PSFs.
</p>

<p>
     Users may wish to set &quot;fwhmsig&quot; to zero and add their
own estimate of the uncertainty in the shape of the PSF to the
uncertainty in the aperture-corrected count rate.  Users should be
aware that the size and shape of the UVOT PSF may vary with time and
filter, so using a single value &quot;fwhmsig&quot; for all exposures
may not be appropriate.  The uncertainty in the FWHM of the PSF is
propagated through the calculation and is added in quadrature to the
corrected uncertainty in the count rate.  Note that a systematic
uncertainty of <em>x</em>% in the FWHM of the PSF corresponds to a
systematic uncertainty of less than <em>x</em>% in the
aperture-corrected count rate.  For example, for the <em>V</em> filter
&quot;fwhmsig=10&quot; corresponds to a systematic error of 2.3% in
the aperture-corrected count rate.  The value of &quot;fwhmsig&quot;
does not affect the value of the aperture correction, only its error.
</p>

<p>
     Another systematic to be aware of is that the PSF is a function
of count rate.  Significant photon coincidence losses will result in
flatter PSFs. A detailed characterization of this effect is pending,
but it will result in the CALDB PSFs becoming increasingly obsolete at
high count rates.  For most small aperture cases, coincidence loss is
not an issue in the sense that if an object is bright enough to have
significant losses then the 5 arcsec aperture should be used to
extract count rates. The PSF is fully-sampled in a 5 arcsec aperture
and no aperture correction will be necessary. However the one
exception is background limited cases where the sky is bright, which
often occurs when observing through the WHITE filter. Currently the
aperture correction systematics attached to such ocurrances are
unquantified.
</p>

<p>
     It is suggested that the current tool provides a useful 1st-order
count rate correction for rapid-response analysis of gamma ray bursts
and targets of opportunity.  However, a more rigorous approach is
recommended for longer-term analysis activities where aperture
corrections are conducted using e.g., curve of growth methods for each
individual exposure in a sequence.
</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>

<dl>

<dt>cntrate [float]</dt>
<dd>The count rate (counts/sec) from a SWIFT-UVOT detected point
    source.  Background count rates must have been subtracted prior to
    running this tool.
</dd>

<dt>ratesig [float]</dt>
<dd>The statistical 1-sigma measurement uncertainty attached to the
    source count rate (counts/sec).
</dd>

<dt>aperad [float]</dt>
<dd>The radius (in arcsec) of the CIRCULAR aperture used to extract
    the count rate.
</dd>

<dt>fwhmsig [float]</dt>
<dd>The systematic rms uncertainty (percent) in the FWHM of the PSF.
    This may be caused by voltage variations during the observing
    sequence, or other effects. &quot;fwhmsig&quot; is a relatively
    nebulous quantity until it can be formally characterized by the
    UVOT team.  A negative value is treated as a request for the
    recommended value.
</dd>

<dt>filter = WHITE|U|B|V|UVW1|UVM2|UVW2 [string]</dt>
<dd>The UVOT filter through which the field was observed. In the
    general case, the filter information is stored both in the image
    filename, as it is extracted from the Archive or Quick-Look
    database, and in the &quot;filter&quot; keyword within the header
    items of each image or event table.  At present the WHITE PSF is
    unavailable, so the B PSF is used if WHITE is requested.
</dd>

<dt>psffile = "CALDB" [filename]</dt>
<dd>The path+name of a FITS table containing CALDB-compliant PSF data.
    This is a simple two-column table containing encircled enery
    fraction (in column REEF) vs PSF radius in arcseconds (in column
    RADIUS). If a FITS HDU (extension) number is provided, the tool
    will open that HDU directly and use its contents. If no HDU is
    provided, the tool will search each extension in the FITS file
    until the keyword &quot;filter&quot; matches argument 'filter'
    above. However, the easiest way to use this function is to
    download the UVOT caldb from
    http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/caldb/swift. If 'CALDB'
    is then provided as the argument to &quot;psffile&quot;, software
    will select the correct file and extension for you.
</dd>

<dt>aperate [float]</dt>
<dd>The aperture-corrected count rate (count/s). This is not an input
    argument. While the corrected count rate is reported to STDOUT at
    the end of the task, it is convenient to have this quantity stores
    as an argument. This can be retrieved by the user or scripts with
    the pget task, e.g., &quot;pget uvotapercorr aperate&quot;.
</dd>

<dt>apersig [float]</dt>
<dd>The 1-sigma error on the aperture corrected count rate
    (count/s). This also is not an input argument. It can be retrieved
    by the user or scripts with the pget task, e.g., &quot;pget
    uvotapercorr apersig&quot;.
</dd>

<dt>(chatter = 1) [enumerated integer]</dt>
<dd>Standard HEAdas chatter parameter (1-5) controlling the verbosity
    of the task. Setting 1 is mute except for the final result
    reported to STDOUT, while setting 5 is the most wordy.
</dd>
