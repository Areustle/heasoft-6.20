Utilities for manipulating images
C. Markwardt

These routines perform basic image manipulations, such as allocation,
reading and writing, and more advanced functions like Fourier
transforms and convolutions.  It depends on the Ooura FFT library
(libbatfftsg.a) for transforming to and from the Fourier domain.

This library also has a selectable precision for the image array type,
being either float or double.  This is controlled by the ISFLOAT
preprocessor directive:
   ISFLOAT == 1   -> data type is float
   ISFLOAT == 0   -> data type is double
of course, the choice must be made at compile time.  The default is 
ISFLOAT == 1 (float).

* imageutils.c: 
  image_init() - allocate image structure, and possibly storage for
        array

  image_free() - deallocate image structure and associated data
  
  image_read() - read image from FITS file
  
  image_write() - write image to FITS file

  image_append() - create new file or append to existing file
  
  image_copykeys() - copy non-structural keywords from one FITS file
         to another

  image_copyinfo() - copy image metadata from one image struct to another

  image_copy() - clone image

  image_writeinfo() - write image metadata to FITS keywords

  image_rescale() - rescale an image, conserving flux.  Calls
         rescalearr()

  image_cmult() - performs complex multiplication in the Fourier
         domain, using the layout of the Ooura FFT library

  image_balance() - rebalance an image so the total is zero

  image_fft() - tranform image to and from the Fourier domain

  image_next2pown() - find next highest power of 2^N

  image_convolve() - convolve an image with a kernel, optionally
      preserving the Fourier transform of the kernel for the future.

  write_wcsaxis() - write WCS-related keywords to FITS file


* rescalearr.c

  rescalearr() - rescale an array to a different pixel size, but
      conserving pixel flux.

* detmask.c - calculates detector mask image

  image_mkdetgaps() - put detector gaps into existing mask image 

  image_mkdetgaps_val() - put detector gaps into existing mask image
                          (arbitrary value)

  image_mkdetmask() - allocate mask image and fill gaps with 0s

* corrections.c

  image_stripbits() - remove user-selectable number of bits from floating
    point values in image.
