BAT Utility Routines

bat_gswdev.h - main include file for this library

CALDB access routines
bat_getcaldbfn.c - CALDB access routine specific to BAT
batcaldb2.c - CALDB access routine specific to BAT
  (almost all tasks use batcaldb2.c)

BAT energy correction routines
bat_read_cal_array.c - OBSOLETE - originally used by baterebin
bat_read_calfiles.c - OBSOLETE - originally used by bateconvert
bat_read_calfiles2.c - OBSOLETE - intermediate routine used by bateconvert
bat_read_cal_coeff.c - read BAT energy correction coefficients
econv.c - energy correction PHA <-> energy for all tasks
ebins.c - read/write energy bin edges
NOTES:
  * originally there were two different library routines that 
    were designed to read essentially the same data in slightly
    different ways (bat_read_calfiles.c and bat_read_cal_array.c)
    for each of the energy correction tasks
    Examples of differences:
      - geographic order vs. detector number order
      - whether adjustments to coefficients are applied in
        library routine or in task
  * new library routine, bat_read_cal_coeff.c, is used for both
    energy conversion tasks to read coefficients
  * new library routine, econv.c, contains energy correction
    logic, which has been moved out of the individual tasks
  * new library routine, ebins.c, contains logic to perform 
    input/output of energy bin values, either at the console
    or from FITS files

Transformation between detector/geographic notation
batidconvert.c - given detector ID, computes geographic/detector info

Mathematical
svd.c - singular value decomposition, used by batclean
