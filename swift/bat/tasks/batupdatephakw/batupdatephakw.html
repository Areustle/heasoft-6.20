<h2>NAME</h2>

batupdatephakw - update BAT ray tracing columns in spectral files

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>batupdatephakw infile auxfile</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
batupdatephakw updates the BAT ray tracing columns in a mask weighted
spectrum.  This is important especially for gamma-ray bursts or other
events where the spacecraft has slewed.  Without the update, the
keywords will reflect the ray tracing status at the <b>end</b> of the
event data set, which will lead to an erroneous detector response
matrix.

<p>
The ray tracing quantities that are updated are: MSKWTSQF, NGOODPIX,
PCODEFR, BAT_XOBJ, BAT_YOBJ, BAT_ZOBJ.

<p>
This script modifies the spectral file in place.  Thus, the spectrum
must be writeable and not compressed.  New columns are created if they
are not already present.  If keywords with the same name are present,
then they are deleted (to prevent confusion with the columns).

<p>
This task requires the "auxiliary" file produce by batmaskwtevt, which
contains the above quantities as a function of time.


<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>infile [filename]

<dd>Input/output spectral file.  The file should be a
batbinevt-derived OGIP standard Type I or Type II spectral file.  The file
should contain at least the TIME and EXPOSURE keywords.  The file is
modified in place.
<p>

<dt>auxfile [filename]

<dd>Name of the "auxiliary" ray trace file produced by batmaskwtevt.  The times
in the auxiliary file should overlap with the times in the spectral
file.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 2) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard
output. <p>

</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>
1. Update the ray tracing columns in a spectral file named
myspectrum.pha.

<pre>
        batupdatephakw myspectrum.pha auxfile.fits
</pre>

auxfile.fits is the "auxiliary" file produced by batmaskwtevt.
