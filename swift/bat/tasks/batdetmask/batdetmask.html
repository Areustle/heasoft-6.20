<h2>NAME</h2>

batdetmask - retrieve BAT gross detector quality map from CALDB

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>batdetmask date outfile</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
batdetmask retrieves a gross detector quality map (bad pixel map) from
CALDB for the time of a given observation.  This quality map is meant
to reflect any operational issues that affected the BAT science data
quality which are not easily extractable from the filter file or other
telemetry.  The user is <i>not</i> excused from doing other routine
quality filtering, for example for SAA or noisy detectors.  Thus, this
task is most useful for doing gross filtering of data at the
observation level to remove detectors with known bad data.

<p>
The master quality maps are stored in CALDB.  This task is merely an
interface to retrieve the correct map for the right time.  The user
can specify the time explicitly, or an FITS file which contains the
time in a header keyword.  The retrieved quality map can also be
combined with an existing user quality map using the detmask
parameter.

<p>
The result is a detector quality map suitable for input to any BAT
task which accepts the detmask parameter.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>date [string]

<dd>The date of observation.  This can be either the date of the exact
form "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss"; OR the Swift mission elapsed time in
seconds as a real number; OR a file name which contains the
observation time in a header keyword.
<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>Name of the output detector quality map file.
<p>

<dt>(keyword = "TSTART") [string]

<dd>If the "date" parameter specifies a file, then the file is
searched for a header keyword of this name.  The keyword value may be
of either of the time formats listed for the "date" parameter.
<p>

<dt>(detmask = "NONE") [string]

<dd>The name of a user quality map which should be combined with the
one from CALDB, or NONE if only the CALDB map is desired.
<p>

<dt>(outcaldbmask = "NONE") [string]

<dd>Upon return, this parameter is set to the global quality map and
extension found from CALDB which matches the time of the observation.
<p>

<dt>(outdetmask = "NONE") [string]

<dd>Upon return, this parameter is set to the detector mask which was selected
(including file name and extension), based on the time of the observation.
<p>

<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If the output file already exists, then setting "clobber = yes" will cause it to be overwritten.
<p>


<dt>(chatter = 2) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard
output. <p>

</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>
1. Retrieve the detector quality map for June 5, 2005,

<pre>
        batdetmask 2005-06-05T00:00:00 master.detmask
</pre>

2. Retrieve the detector quality map based on the TSTART keyword
in file myfile.dpi.

<pre>
        batdetmask myfile.dpi master.detmask keyword=TSTART
</pre>
