<h2>NAME</h2>

batclean - read in a DPI and clean out a fit to the diffuse background

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>batclean infile outfile incatalog [detmask] <i>[options]</i> </tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
This tool fits a simple background or source plus background model to
a detector plane image.  The code contains a default background model
which is described below.  The user can also specify one or more
background models to be fit using the bkgmodel parameter.  The output
file can be either the cleaned focal plane (default), the fit to the
detector plane or the original input file.  The fitting is performed
as a linear combination of background components, via singular value
decomposition.
<p>
The tool can also, optionally, balance the detector plane either
before or after or instead of cleaning.  See below under the "balance"
parameter for more details.
<p>
This code reads in a Detector Plane Image (DPI) file as well as an
optional detector quality mask file.  If no detector mask file is
provided, then all detectors with non-zero data are included in the
fit.

<h3>Source Cleaning</h3>

<p>
Since BAT is a coded mask instrument, bright sources can contribute
counts to a large portion of the detector.  These source introduce
their own 'coding noise' which is approximately 1% of the source
intensity.  By modeling and subtracting the contributions of bright
sources, the coding noise can be reduced significantly (Although the
effects cannot be completely removed.)

<p>
If one or more sources are to be cleaned from the DPI (default), then
set srcclean='YES' and enter an input catalog ('incatalog').  All
sources with significance greater than 'snrclean' will be modeled and
cleaned.  batclean which uses a forward projection to create a model
template for each source; the fit coefficient is the normalization
(intensity) of the source.
<p>

The input catalog must contain columns "IMX," "IMY," "CATNUM," (or
"SOURCE_ID"), "NAME," and "SNR."  The tool reads the source position
in BAT image coordinates from this file and uses the source position
to forward project a model of the source flux onto the focal
plane.


<h3>Background Cleaning</h3>
<p>
The purpose of background cleaning is to model and remove smoothly
varying gradients in the detector plane image.  These gradients are
typically dominated by the cosmic X-ray background, which peaks at the
center of the detector plane image.  If these trends are not removed,
the coded mask image will contain increased 'pattern noise' which will
reduce the sensitivity to real sources.

<p>
By default, a simple background model is used, which contains linear
and quadratic spatial gradients.  It has the following
parameters:
<ul>
<li> 1 = constant,   2 = proportional to X,  3 = proportional to Y    
<li> 4 = proportional to X<sup>2</sup>,  5 = proportional to Y<sup>2</sup>
<li> 6 = proportional to X Y, 
<li> 7 = Detector on left (-X) side of sandwiches: constant,
<li> 8 = Left side detectors: proportional to X,    
<li> 9 = Detector on right (+X) side of sandwiches: constant,
<li> 10 = Right side detectors: proportional to X,    
<li> 11 = Detectors on front (-Y) side of sandwiches: constant,
<li> 12 = Front side detectors: proportional to Y,    
<li> 13 = Detectors on back (+Y) side of sandwiches: constant,
<li> 14 = Back side detectors: proportional to Y,    
</ul>
<p>
The code creates a background template maps based on the model above
(which can be optionally output using the <i>backexp</i> parameter).
In addition to the simple model, the user can supply custom model
template files, and these will be fitted with a linear normalization
component.  The custom model templates must be in the same format as a
DPI (i.e. 286 x 173 image extensions), one image extension per
template.


<p>
The tool then uses a singular value decomposition method to fit a
linear combination of all source and background templates to the
counts data of the DPI.  The fit coefficients are then used to create
a model background map.

<h3>Balancing</h3>

<p>
batclean is also capable of "balancing" the detector plane counts.
Balancing involves subtracting DC biases from certain combinations of
detectors which are thought to have systematic offsets.  The BAT
flight software itself also does balancing on-board Swift.  The most
obvious case of this is to subtract the global-average counts from all
detectors, but there are other possible combinations.  The purpose of
balancing is to further reduce pattern noise due to systematic
features in the detector counts (for example, each detector module is
biased slightly differently).  Since these structures do not
correspond to the shadowgrams of real sources, they only contribute
noise, and can be subtracted without reducing sensitivity to real
sources.  If a detector quality mask is given (via 'detmask'), then
only non-masked detectors are included in the balancing.


<p>
If any balancing operation is enabled via the 'balance' keyword
parameter, the task will also balance the entire array, or subsets of
the array, as specified in the table below.  The balancing that is
requested is given by supplied a comma-separated list of any or all of
the following values.  The balance is performed in the order in which
the values are listed.  Balancing is not commutative, so order is
significant. 

<p>
Allowed balance values:
<ul>
<li> 'none' - no balancing;
<li> 'All' - the entire array is balanced (1 balancing of 32768 detectors);
<li> 'Module' - each of the 256 detector modules is separately balanced;
<li> 'InOut' - each module has its inner detectors balanced and in separate 
operations, its outer detectors balanced (for a total of 512 balancings);
<li> 'Edges' - each module has only its outer (or edge) detectors balanced;
<li> 'LongEdges' - each row that contains module edge detectors is balanced separately (for a total of 32);
<li> 'ShortEdges' - each column that contains module edge detectors is balanced separately (for a total of 32);
<li> 'flight' - reproduce the flight code balancing, which is equivalent to 'ShortEdges,LongEdges,InOut' in that order.
</ul>


<h3>Output File</h3>

<p>
The output file will contain detector plane maps with the result of
the cleaning operation, i.e. a series of DPIs, one for each input DPI.
The actual <i>meaning</i> of the data values depends on the
'outversion' parameter:
<ul>
<li> outversion='cleaned' - cleaned DPI, that is, original counts minus fitted model;
<li> outversion='original' - original DPI filtered by the detector mask;
<li> outversion='fit' - fitted source+background model;
<li> outversion='bkgfit' - fitted background-only model;
<li> outversion='bkgcleaned' - background-cleaned DPI, that is, original counts minus fitted background-only model;
<li> outversion='srcfit' - fitted source-only model;
<li> outversion='srccleaned' - background-cleaned DPI, that is, original counts minus fitted source-only model;
</ul>
Depending on the 'maskfit' parameter, the output data values may or
may not be masked by the quality map.  batclean writes the fit
coefficients to the output file as keywords, as follows:
<ul>
<li> BGPARnn - fit coefficients for background model;
<li> SRPARnn - normalization coefficients for each source, if source cleaning is requested; the corresponding source name is printed in the comment field.
</ul>

<p>  

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>infile [filename]

<dd>Input file name.  The name of the input DPI file.  This is expected to
be an image array with dimensions equal to the number of detector columns 
by the number of detector rows (set to 286 X 173).  If there are multiple 
BAT_DPI image extensions then all are cleaned and multiple cleaned images
are written to the output file.
<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>Output file name.  See above for description of output file
contents, which depends on the 'outversion' parameter.
<p>

<dt>incatalog = "NONE" [filename]

<dd>Input source catalog.  The format of the catalog file is that
output by the BAT tool <i>batcelldetect</i>.  See above for the format
description.  By default the first table extension is opened, unless
an explicit extension is provided.  If no source cleaning is
requested, then set incatalog='NONE'.  See also the 'srcclean'
parameter.
<p>

<dt>(aperture = "CALDB:FLUX") [filename]

<dd>Aperture file.  The default is the aperture file in the CALDB
area.  This parameter may be omitted or set to "NONE" if only
background cleaning is required (i.e., the <i>srcclean</i> parameter
set to "NO").  If several aperture types are available in the CALDB,
the user can specify CALDB:<i>apertype</i>.  Valid values of apertype are
currently: FLUX or DETECTION, for apertures optimized for flux
reproducibility or detection sensitivity, respectively.
<p>

<dt>(detmask = "NONE") [filename]

<dd>Name of a detector quality mask file.  This should be an image
file with the same dimensions as the focal plane map.  A pixel value
of 0 indicates the detector is enabled for imaging, and any other
value indicates the detector should be ignored.  A default value of
'NONE' implies all detectors are on, except for the BAT detector gap
regions. It is strongly recommended to use a detector mask file if one
is available.  The quality of the fit, especially to calibration data
is greatly improved if only working detectors are included in the
fits.
<p>

<dt>(wtmapin = "NONE") [filename]

<dd>Name of an input error map.  This is used to provide weights for
the fitting in case one is cleaning a DPI which does not have Poisson
statistics (such as an already cleaned DPI).  The typical sequence would
be to create an error map using the <i>wtmapout</i> parameter on the first
cleaning and then read this error map in on the second cleaning.  If an
already cleaned image is cleaned without an input error map than uniform
weighting is used.
<p>

<dt>(wtmapout = "NONE") [filename]

<dd>Name of an output error map. If a filename is specified then the tool
writes out a DPI containing the calculated weights for each detector.  This
can be used on subsequent cleanings as the input <i>wtmapin</i> error map.
<p>

<dt>(backexp = "NONE") [filename]

<dd> If the name of a file is given here, then the background model will
be output to this file.  The format is a binary table with one column for 
each model parameter.  The data is written in DPH format, or as a 286 X 173
element array, one number per detector.  This table gives the model <i>
which was fit</i> to the data, not the actual fit to the data.  The final
column in the table is the covariance matrix from the fit.
<p>

<dt>(bat_z = 0) [real]

<dd> This is the z-component of the distance to the source in BAT_Z
coordinates (the vertical distance of the source from the origin of the
BAT coordinate system).  This parameter is ignored if <i>srcclean</i> =
"NO."  If the <i>incatalog</i> contains a BAT_Z keyword, then the value
of the keyword is used and the value of the <i>bat_z</i> parameter is not
used.  Note that the default value of 0 corresponds to a source at infinity.
<p>

<dt>(bkgmodel = "simple") [string]

<dd> This optional parameter indicates the background model to be
fitted to the input counts.  The possible values are: "simple" (simple
background model as described above); "none" (no background fit); or
user-specified custom templates.  For user-specified custom templates,
bkgmodel should be a list of background templates, which can be: a
comma-separated list of one or more template filenames, or a filename
such as "@filename.txt" where the specified file contains a list of
model files separated by carriage returns.  By default the 'simple'
model is combined with user-specified templates, unless the special
string "useronly" is specified as one of the filenames.
<p>

<dt>(srcclean = "YES") [boolean]

<dd>Determines whether sources are cleaned from the input DPI or only
background.  If this parameter is "YES," then an <i>incatalog</i> and
<i>aperture</i> file must be supplied.
<p>

<dt>(cleansnr = 6.0) [real]

<dd>Only sources with a signal-to-noise ratio as read from the 
<i>incatalog</i> higher than this value are cleaned from the DPI.
If no sources have a signal-to-noise ratio above the <i>cleansnr</i>
value, then only the background will be cleaned.
<p>

<dt>(snrcol = "SNR") [string]

<dd>Name of catalog column to be used with 'cleansnr' for signal to
noise thresholding.  By default it is "SNR", but any column can be
used to trigger cleaning.
<p>


<dt>(ignore = "UNKNOWN") [string]

<dd> Unless this parameter is set to "NONE" or "none," the cleaning code
will not clean any source in <i>incatalog</i> whose NAME matches the
<i>ignore</i> string.  The user can either specify a particular source
name, the strings "IGNORE" or "NONE", or the name of a file (preceded by
"@").  If a file name is supplied, then the file must contain a list of
sources to be ignored, once source per line.  Note that source names to
be ignored must match <i>exactly</i> (including spaces, capitalization,
etc.) the names in the catalog.  

<p>

<dt>(balance = "none") [string]

<dd> Comma-separated list of balancing operations to perform, in
order, or 'none' to indicate no balancing.  See the 'balancing'
section above for more information.

<p>

<dt>(balfirst = "NO") [boolean]

<dd> If 'no' then balancing is done after cleaning.  However, by
setting this parameter to 'yes' then balancing can be done before
cleaning.

<p>

<dt>(maskfit = "NO") [boolean]

<dd> If this parameter is set to "YES" and <i>outversion</i>="fit"
then the output file contains the fit parameters for all detectors
even those masked using a <i>detmask</i>.  The quality map is always
applied during the fitting and balancing operations regardless of the
setting of 'maskfit'.  'maskfit' only alters how the data values in the
output file are written.
<p>

<dt>(leadedge = "NO") [boolean]

<dd> If this parameter is set to "YES," then the leading edge detectors 
(those on the two edges of detector module sides facing toward the source)
are fit separately from the rest of the detectors.  Since the current
forward projection code does not correctly handle these edge detectors, 
setting this parameter does not significantly affect the overall clean.
<p>

<dt>(eff_edge = 0.2) [float]

<dd> The depth of edge (cm) to consider effective.  Range from 0.03 to 0.2.
Normally this 
<p>

<dt>(corrections = "none") [string]

<dd>Comma-separated list of corrections to apply to the mask
weighting, or "none" if no corrections are to be applied.  Note that
corrections are only applied to the forward projection for sources.
This parameter has no effect if only the background is to be cleaned.
<p>
Possible correction types are: "flatfield" (basic flat fielding
correction accounting for both cosine-type and r-squared-type
effects); "nearfield" (for ground testing results where the source
is at a finite distance -- requires bat_z != 0); 
"cosine" (cosine effects of off-axis illumination
only); "rsquare" (r-squared effects only); "opaque" (activates a 
new algorithm for calculating the mask transmission function);
"sides" (effects of sides of detectors XXX not implemented). 
<p>

<dt>(outversion = "cleaned") [string]

<dd> This optional parameter indicates the meaning of the data values
in the output file.  See the "Output File" section above for more
information.  Choice of <i>outversion</i> parameter dictates what
value is written to the HDUCLAS2 keyword.  Possible values are:
<ul>
<li> original:  HDUCLAS2 is unchanged
<li> cleaned or bkgcleaned or srcleaned:  HDUCLAS2 = RESIDUAL
<li> fit or bkgfit or srcfit: HDUCLAS2 = PREDICTED
</ul>


<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If the output file already exists, then setting "clobber = yes" will cause it to be overwritten.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard output.
Setting chatter = 4 or higher will produce detailed diagnostic output; 
chatter = 2 prints out a basic diagnostic message.  The default is to 
produce no printed output.

<p>

<dt>(history = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If history = YES, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written to
the header of the specified HDU in the output file to record the value
of all the ftcopy task parameters that were used to produce the output
file.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Note that when commands are issued on the Unix command line, strings
containing special characters such as '[' or ']' must be enclosed in
single or double quotes.

<p>
<i>
The following examples illustrate ways in which batclean can be used.
</i>

<p>
1. Fit the simple background model to a DPI with a detector mask file.  
Output the cleaned DPI and a background exposure map. 

<p>
<pre>
    batclean input.dpi cleaned.dpi detmask=bat.mask backexp=backexp2.dph 
srcclean=NO
</pre>

2. Fit a set of source models along with a simple background model to a DPI, 
using the default aperture file.  Output the fit to the focal plane instead of
the cleaned focal plane.  A flat-fielding correction is applied in the
forward projection.

<p>

<pre>
    batclean input.dpi fit.dpi catalog.tbl detmask=bat.mask outversion="fit"
corrections="flatfield"
</pre>

3. Fit two user-supplied background models in addition to the hard-coded
model.
<p>
<pre> 
   batclean input.dpi cleaned.dpi detmask=bat.mask bkgmodel=model1.dpi,model2.dpi
</pre>

4. Same example, except the user gives the two model files as lines in the
text file "models.lst."
<p>
<pre>
   batclean input.dpi cleaned.dpi detmask=bat.mask bkgmodel=@models.lst
</pre>

5. Balancing is performed after cleaning, applying the Module and InOut
balancings.
<p>
<pre>
    batclean input.dpi cleaned.dpi detmask=bat.mask balance=Module,InOut
