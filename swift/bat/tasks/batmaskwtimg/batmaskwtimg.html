<h2>NAME</h2>

batmaskwtimg - compute mask weights for the entire detector BAT plane

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>batmaskwtimg outfile attitude ra dec</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
batmaskwtimg constructs a mask weighting map, for a particular source
position, for the entire BAT detector plane.  This is the first step
to computing a flux or spectrum for a source from survey type or image
type data.  The output is an image of the detector plane with one mask
weight for each detector.
</p>

<p>
Users can also compute a "forward" ray tracing map, which gives the
expected counts in each detector based on a unit intensity source,
accounting for various geometric optics effects.  Users should use
"corrections=forward,unbalanced,flatfield" and "rebalance=no" in order
to simulate such a map.
</p>

<p>
Users can also request analysis for a batch of sources in a catalog,
using the 'incatalog' parameter.  The catalog must provide at least
the source position (and optionally the name of the source and an
identifying number).  By default, the output will contain multiple
extensions, one for each source.  However, individual catalog maps can
be combined into one map with the combmeth parameter.  <b>NOTE:</b> If
the input catalog is empty, then no output catalog will be created.
If 'clobber=yes' is set and the input catalog is empty, then any
pre-existing output file will be erased.
</p>

<p>
The actual output map type is controlled by the 'outtype' parameter.
By default it is WEIGHTS, indicating to output the ray traced mask
weights.  If outtype=ZERO or outtype=NONZERO is chosen, then a
"footprint" mask is made instead, which shows which parts of the
aperture (or non-aperture) illuminates the array, regardless of the
aperture pattern.  This may be especially useful in combination with
combmeth="MIN" or "MAX", to mask out portions of the array illuminated
by particular sources.

<p>
By default, the coordinates are right ascension and declination.
Users must also provide the instrument aperture and teldef files (or
use CALDB).  Instrument coordinates can also be used, as described in
ADVANCED COORDINATE SYSTEMS below.
</p>

<p><b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> the "teldef" definition of Swift and BAT
attitude has changed throughout the mission (in particular,
August-September 2007).  Therefore it is crucially important to
specify an "infile" so that the teldef file with the appropriate date
can be chosen.
</p>

<h2>ADVANCED COORDINATE SYSTEMS</h2>

<p>
Users may specify a source position using a coordinate system other
than sky position.  Depending on the value of the coord_type
parameter, the user may give the cartesian or angular position of the
source in instrument coordinates.  When coord_type is changed from
"sky" to any of the other coordinate systems, then the meaning of the
ra and dec parameters changes according to the following table:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
        COORD_TYPE      RA parameter        DEC parameter     Units
        ------------------------------------------------------------
        sky             Right Ascension     Declination        deg
        tanxy           Tan(theta_x)        Tan(theta_y)       none
        cartesian       BAT_X position      BAT_Y position     cm
        unit            BAT_X unit vector   BAT_Y unit vector  none
        fswlonlat       Phi (flt. software) Theta              deg
        grmclonlat      Longitude (GRMC)    Latitude           deg
</pre>

<p>
The coordinate types "fswlonlat" and "grmclonlat" are coordinate
systems used in the flight software and instrument simulators.  The
coordinate type "tanxy" gives the tangent-plane angles of the source.
Where necessary the source distance and/or BAT_Z position must also be
provided (in centimeters).
</p>

<h2>DISTORTION CORRECTION</h2>

<p>
Batmaskwtevt can correct for systematic non-linear centroid shifts in
the BAT imaging system.  It is assumed that the input position (either
celestial or instrumental) is in "true" undistorted coordinates.  All
distortion corrections occur internally within the task.  The
distortion correction occurs if the 'distfile' parameter points to a
correction map.
</p>

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>Output image file name.  The mask weight map will be written to
the primary extension of this file.
<p>

<dt>attitude [string]

<dd>File name of Swift attitude history, or NONE if none is used.
<p>

<dt>ra [real]

<dd>Right ascension of source in decimal degrees, or other source
position coordinate, depending on coord_type.  This value is ignored
if incatalog is specified.
<p>

<dt>dec [real]

<dd>Declination of source in decimal degrees, or other source
position coordinate, depending on coord_type.  This value is ignored
if incatalog is specified.
<p>


<dt>(infile = "NONE") [string]

<dd>The name of an input file containing valid Swift/BAT time and
instrument keywords.  For example, an existing detector plane image.
The time and instrument keywords are used to select the proper CALDB
files, and also to determine the TSTART/TSTOP time for the output
file.  The keywords in infile are also cloned to the output file.  If
given, the 'time' parameter overrides TSTART/TSTOP in infile.  By
default the midpoint time is used to compute the spacecraft attitude.
<p>


<dt>(aperture = "CALDB")[filename]

<dd>BAT aperture map file name, which contains the coded mask pattern
and alignment parameters.  If the CALDB database is set up, then CALDB
can also be specified.  If several aperture types are available in the
CALDB, the user can specify CALDB:<i>apertype</i>.  Valid values of apertype
are currently: FLUX, DETECTION, or MASK_EDGES; for apertures optimized
for flux reproducibility, detection sensitivity, or for the shadow of
the edge of the mask, respectively.
<p>



<dt>(coord_type = "sky") [string]

<dd>Method of specifying the source coordinates.  It should be one of:
"sky"; "tanxy" (coordinates expressed in tangent-plane coordinates);
"cartesian" (source at cartesian position in BAT coordinates); "unit"
(unit vector direction in BAT coordinates); "fswlonlat" (flight
software phi and theta); "grmclonlat" (source at simulator longitude
and latitude).  All coordinate types but the first are specified in
the instrument coordinate system.
<p>

<dt>(time = 0) [real]

<dd>Time associated with the mask weighted image.  When coordinates
are used, it is also possible for the attitude to change as a function
of time.  Specify the mission elapsed time of interest with this
parameter.  A value of 0 (the default) indicates to use the first row
of the attitude file, or the time in 'infile' if it is present.
Ignored for non-sky coordinate systems.
<p>

<dt>(rebalance = YES) [boolean]

<dd>If YES, then the mask weight map will be adjusted so
that its additive mean is zero.  If NO, then, the map will be
written unadjusted.
<p>

<dt>(bat_z = 0) [real]

<dd>Position of the source in BAT_Z coordinates, if coord_type is
"cartesian" (in units of cm).
<p>

<dt>(incatalog = "NONE") [string]

<dd>Input source catalog containing source positions.  The catalog
should contain one row per source.  A value of NONE indicates that the
source coordinates should be taken from the command line.
<p>

<dt>(racol = "RA_OBJ") [string]

<dd>Column name of the first coordinate value in the input catalog,
typically right ascension.
<p>

<dt>(deccol = "DEC_OBJ") [string]

<dd>Column name of the second coordinate value in the input catalog,
typically declination.
<p>

<dt>(namecol = "NAME") [string]

<dd>Column name of the source name in the input catalog.  This value
is written to the output keyword named 'OBJECT'.  If NONE is
specified, then this column is ignored.
<p>

<dt>(catnumcol = "CATNUM") [string]

<dd>Column name of the source catalog number in the input catalog.
This value is written to the output keyword named 'CATNUM'.  If NONE
is specified, then this column is ignored.
<p>

<dt>(outtype = "WEIGHTS") [string]

<dd>Type of output map (one of WEIGHTS, ZERO or NONZERO).  For ZERO,
the test (weight == 0) is performed on each pixel; for NONZERO, the
test (weight != 0) is performed.  (1=true; 0=false).
<p>

<dt>(combmeth = "NONE") [string]

<dd>Method of combining multiple maps (one of NONE, MIN, MAX or SUM).
If NONE, then multiple maps are output individually.  If MIN/MAX/SUM,
the minimum/maximum/total value is output for each pixel.
<p>

<dt>(distance = 1.0e7) [real]

<dd>Default bat_z position if bat_z is zero (centimeters).
<p>

<dt>(maskoffx = 0.0) [real]

<dd>Translational offset to apply to the mask along the BAT_X
coordinate from its nominal design position.
<p>

<dt>(maskoffy = 0.0) [real]

<dd>Translational offset to apply to the mask along the BAT_Y
coordinate from its nominal design position.
<p>

<dt>(maskoffz = 0.0) [real]

<dd>Translational offset to apply to the mask along the BAT_Z
coordinate from its nominal design position.
<p>

<dt>(maskthickness = INDEF) [string]

<dd>Thickness of the lead mask tiles in centimeters.  Normally this
will be set to INDEF, which reads the mask thickness from the aperture
file.  A thickness of 0 cm is permitted.
<p>

<dt>(distfile=CALDB) [string]

<dd>
The 'distfile' parameter should point to a FITS file containing an
MxNx2 image (or CALDB to use the default instrument correction in the
calibration database).  The two planes of the image are the non-linear
distortion of the BAT "plate scale" as a function of position in the
sky image.  The values are offsets in tangent plane coordinates
(IMX,IMY), and therefore unitless.  The first plane of the image cube
is the IMX offset, and the second plane is the IMY offset.  The sense
of the offset is (TRUE-APPARENT), i.e. for a measured position in
tangent plane coordinates, the offset values should be *added* to
arrive at the true position in tangent plane coordinates.  The images
are low-resolution versions of the BAT field of view in instrumental
sky coordinates, and are meant to be interpolated to the desired
sampling.  The WCS keywords must specify the image coordinate systems.
<p>

<dt>(corrections = "default") [string]

<dd>Comma-separated list of corrections to apply to the mask
weighting, or "none" if no corrections are to be applied.  The
possible corrections are:
<dl>
<dt>default<dd>Default corrections, which is shorthand for: "flatfield,ndets,pcode,maskwt"
<dt>flatfield<dd>Apply corrections for cosine and edge projection effects
<dt>maskwt<dd>Apply corrections for mask weighting technique
<dt>pcode<dd>Apply partial coding corrections
<dt>ndets<dd>Normalize by number of exposed detectors
<dt>subpixelate<dd>Use slower but potentially higher fidelity algorithm
<dt>forward<dd>Reserved for clean procedure
<dt>unbalanced<dd>Reserved for clean procedure
<dt>nearfield<dd>Near field corrections for ground calibration analysis only
</dl>

<b>The "pcode" and "ndets" corrections require the user to supply the
detmask keyword.</b>

<p>

<dt>(detmask = "NONE") [string]

<dd>Name of a detector quality map file.  This should be an image file
with the same dimensions as the detector plane map.  A pixel value of
0 indicates the detector is enabled, and a non-zero value indicates
disabled.  A default value of NONE implies all detectors are on,
except for the BAT detector gap regions.  This map is only used for
computing the fraction of illuminated pixels.  The output mask weight
map contains a value of zero for all bad quality pixels.
detmask.
<p>

<dt>(subpixsize = 0.02) [real]

<dd>Size of detector subpixels used in computing mask weighting, in
centimeters.  Can be no larger than 0.02 cm.
<p>

<dt>(teldef = "CALDB") [string]

<dd>BAT instrument telescope description file, which defines
instrument-to-spacecraft alignments.  Must be specified when celestial
coordinates are provided.  If the CALDB database is set up, then CALDB
can also be specified.

<dd>Value to place in image cells where detector gaps are located.
<p>

<dt>(origin_z = 0) [real]

<dd>For ground testing with a near-field source.  The position of the
origin of coordinates (in cm), to which the source position is referred.
<p>

<dt>(maskwtswgain = 0.04) [real]

<dd>Mask weight technique software gain correction factor.  When
corrections=maskwt, the weights are divided by (1+maskwtswgain).  This
is correction is software algorithm dependent and not intended to be
changed by the user.
<p>

<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If the output file already exists, then setting "clobber = yes" will cause it to be overwritten.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 2) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard
output.  Setting chatter = 1 produces a basic summary of the task
actions; chatter = 2 (default) additionally prints a summary of input
parameters; chatter = 5 prints debugging information.
<p>

<dt>(history = YES) [boolean]

<dd>If history = YES, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written to
the header of the specified HDU in the output file to record the value
of all the task parameters that were used to produce the output
file.
