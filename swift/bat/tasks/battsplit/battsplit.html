<h2>NAME</h2>

battsplit - split a good time interval into smaller parts

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>battsplit infile outfile tolerance=...</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
The battsplit task is able to split an existing good time interval
into smaller part, according to a user specified splitting criterium.
By default, the intervals are split whenever the Swift spacecraft has
slewed more than X degrees, where X is given by the 'tolerance'
parameter.

<p>
For this method to work, the 'infile' parameter should be set to the 
auxiliary ray trace file produced by batbinevt.  The user should also
probably enter a 'gtifile', specifying some time intervals of interest.

<p>
Upon output, a new GTI file will be created.  The original time
intervals may be broken up into smaller adjoining pieces according to
the user-set criterium.  The criterium is satisfied when the 'expr'
differencing expression changes by more than 'tolerance' (both 'expr'
and 'tolerance' are parameters).

<p>
For the purposes of calculating the expression, the values in the
input table are assumed to be constant at the corresponding TIME
value, until the the time of the next row.  I.e. the input file is
treated as piecewise-constant.

<b>IMPORTANT NOTES:</b> For BAT data, care must be taken when feeding
the output of this task to the 'mgtime' task, or any other task that
merges GTIs.  Most tasks will attempt to combine adjoining GTIs, and
thus the splitting operation will be erased.  It is expected that the
user will feed this GTI directly into the 'batbinevt' task, for use
with 'user'-style time binning.

Also, users should make sure that the input file has enough time
sampling to well-cover each of the good time intervals specified in
'gtifile'.  If the input file is too coarsely sampled, the split times
may be inaccurate.

<p>
The default expression computes the angular distance traveled by the
Swift spacecraft, in degrees.  Any other expression can be used, in
the CFITSIO calculator style, so long as it computes the difference
between two rows.  For example, if one is interested in changes in the
single column called "VALUE", the difference expression would be written as,
<pre>

  expr='ABS(VALUE-VALUE{-1})
</pre>
The 'VALUE{-1}' expression is CFITSIO calculator notation to use the
value from the previous row.  Thus, the difference expression simply
computes the linear change between rows.  battsplit will take care of 
calculating the <i>accumulated</i> difference over multiple rows,
and determining when the 'tolerance' has been crossed.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>infile [filename]

<dd>
Input file name.  For BAT operation, this should be the auxiliary raytrace
file produced by batmaskwtevt.
<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>
Output file name.  The output will contain a set of good time intervals.
<p>

<dt>(gtifile = 'NONE') [string]
<dd>
Name of input good time interval file, or 'NONE'.  battsplit will
split up the 'gtifile'.  If no 'gtifile' is specified, then battsplit
will split the time interval (-infinity,+infinity).
<p>

<dt>(tolerance = 5.0) [real]
<dd>
Amount of change in the difference expression required before an
interval is split.
<p>

<dt>(expr = 'SQRT((IMX-IMX{-1})^2 + (IMY-IMY{-1})^2)/#deg') [string]
<dd>
The difference expression, which should compute the difference between two
rows, as described above.  The default expression computes the angular
difference between two rows in the BAT auxiliary ray trace file, based
on the tangent plane coordinates IMX and IMY, with the result expressed
in units of degrees.
<p>

<dt>(diffcol = '_DIFF') [string]
<dd>
Name of difference expression column, created in scratch file.
<p>

<dt>(cleanup = 'YES') [boolean]
<dd>
Boolean which determines whether temporary scratch files are cleaned
up or not.
<p>


<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If the output file already exists, then setting "clobber = yes" will cause it to be overwritten.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 2) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard
output.  Setting chatter = 1 produces a basic summary of the task
actions; chatter = 2 (default) additionally prints a summary of input
parameters; chatter = 5 prints debugging information.
<p>

<dt>(history = YES) [boolean]

<dd>If history = YES, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written to
the header of the specified HDU in the output file to record the value
of all the task parameters that were used to produce the output
file.

</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>

1. Split the T90 time interval in dur.gti into 5 degree intervals.  
The result is placed in split.gti.

<p>
<pre>
     battsplit sw00340895000b_all.evaux split.gti tolerance=5.0 \
       gtifile=dur.gti'[GTI_T90]'
</pre>
