<h2>NAME</h2>

batoccultmap - compute BAT exposure mask due to occultation

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>batoccultmap infile outfile saofile</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
batoccultmap computes the fractional exposure in the BAT field of view
due to occultation by the earth, moon and/or sun.  The BAT field of
view is large enough that any of these bodies may occult cosmic
sources.  Since the bodies move with time, the task computes the
exposure map as a function of time and merges the results.  This task
is used for sky images; if you want to data selection for the
visibility of a single source, use batoccultgti.

<p>
The task can be run in two modes.  If occultation="any", then any
portion of the image which is blocked at any time is masked in the
output.  If occultation="fraction", then the fractional exposure is
computed (a value between 0 and 1).

<p>
The user must supply the "SAO" file created by prefilter.  This file
contains the positions of the earth, moon and sun as a function of
time.  The sizes of the earth, moon and sun are configurable.


<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>infile [filename]

<dd>The name (and optional extension) of the input image file name.
<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>The name of the output map file.  For occultation="fraction", the
map will range continuously from 0.0 to 1.0, corresponding to the
partial exposure.  For occultation="any", the map will be either 0.0
(occulted at some time) or 1.0 (never occulted).
<p>

<dt>saofile [filename]

<dd>The name of the "SAO" file produced by prefilter.  This file
should contain the columns TIME, RA, DEC, ROLL, SAT_ALT, MOON_RA,
MOON_DEC, SUN_RA, SUN_DEC, EARTH_RA, EARTH_DEC.
<p>

<dt>atmdepth = 5.0 [real]

<dd>Thickness of the earth "atmosphere" in kilometers.  Points within
this thickness are assumed to have zero exposure.
<p>

<dt>rearth = 6378.1 [real]

<dd>The effective radius of the earth in kilometers.  The default
value is the mean equatorial radius (a conservative number).
<p>

<dt>rmoon = 16.0 [real]

<dd>The effective radius of the moon in arcminutes.  The default value
is conservatively set at 0.5 arcminutes larger than the true value.
<p>

<dt>rsun = 16.5 [real]

<dd>The effective radius of the sun in arcminutes.  The default value
is conservatively set at 0.5 arcminutes larger than the true value.
<p>

<dt>method = "time" [string]

<dd>Time segmentation method, used for subdividing good time
intervals.  For method="time", good time intervals are divided into
subintervals no larger than timesegtol seconds.  For
method="position", good time intervals are divided so that the
spacecraft and earth/moon/sun move no more than timesegtol arcminutes.
<p>

<dt>timesegtol = 0.0 [real]

<dd>Time segmentation parameter (see "method" above).  Generally
smaller values will provide higher fidelity, but take longer to
compute.  A value of zero indicates the defaults of 3 arcmin / 10
seconds should be used.

<p>

<dt>occultation [string]

<dd>Either "any" or "fraction".  See "outfile" above.
<p>

<dt>constraints = "EARTH" [string]

<dd>A comma-separated list of the constraints to check (EARTH, MOON
and/or SUN).  Note that automatic inclusion of the MOON and SUN is not
recommended, because both are comparable to the size of a BAT point
source and may confuse the source detection software.
<p>

<dt>gtifile = "INFILE" [string]

<dd>Name of file containing the good time interval extension.  The
file is searched for the first extension matching "*GTI*".  A value of
"INFILE" indicates to search the input file.  A value of "NONE"
indicates to use the TSTART/TSTOP image header keywords.
<p>

<dt>(multfiles = "NONE") [string]

<dd>
Comma-separated list of image filenames to be corrected using the
calculated correction image (or "@filename.lis" to supply a list of
files in filename.lis).  Images are corrected <b>IN PLACE</b> (i.e. no
back-up is made) by MULTIPLYING the original image values by the
correction.
<p>

<dt>(divfiles = "NONE") [string]

<dd>
Comma-separated list of image filenames to be corrected using the
calculated correction image (or "@filename.lis" to supply a list of
files in filename.lis).  Images are corrected <b>IN PLACE</b> (i.e. no
back-up is made) by DIVIDING the original image values by the
correction.
<p>

<dt>(algorithm = "CONTOUR") [string]

<dd>
Name of algorithm to use, either IMAGE or CONTOUR.  The IMAGE method
computes visibility for each pixel; the CONTOUR method computes the
contours of each object in pixel coordinates.  By virtue of the
algorithms, the two results are slightly different (CONTOUR produces
slightly larger occultation regions).
<p>

<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If the output file already exists, then setting "clobber = yes" will cause it to be overwritten.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 2) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard
output.  Setting chatter = 1 produces a basic summary of the task
actions; chatter = 2 (default) additionally prints a summary of input
parameters; chatter = 5 prints debugging information.
<p>

<dt>(history = YES) [boolean]

<dd>If history = YES, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written to
the header of the specified HDU in the output file to record the value
of all the task parameters that were used to produce the output
file.

</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>

1. Computes the fractional exposure map for the primary HDU of
sky.img.  Good time intervals are subdivided so that the spacecraft
attitude/earth/moon/sun do not move more than 3 arcmin (the default).
