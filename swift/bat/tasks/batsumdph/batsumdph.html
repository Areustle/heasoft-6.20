<h2>NAME</h2>
batsumdph - (OBSOLETE) Add specified rows in a BAT_DPH table and generate a new,
            single-row BAT_DPH extension.


<h2>USAGE</h2>



<tt>batsumdph infile outfile rows="&lt;row_ranges&gt;" clobber = "yes"
    chatter=5  </tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<b>NOTE: This task is not supported for scientific analysis.  Please
use the 'batbinevt' task to sum survey DPHs.</b>

<p>
This tool sums up detector by detector and energy bin by energy bin,
the user specified rows in an input BAT Detector Plane Histogram (DPH) 
to produce a single summed DPH.  The user can specify any set of rows
in the input DPH to be summed.  The GTI extension of the output DPH
contains the times of the rows that were actually summed.

<p>
The number
of rows in the corresponding GTI extension of the new FITS
file depends on the number of rows specified. The GTI START
value of each GTI extension row is the start time of the
corresponding selected row. The stop time of that row is the
start time + the EXPOSURE value of the corresponding row
in the original BAT_DPH extension. The EBOUNDS extension is 
copied "as is" to the new file.
<p>

<p>
Any specified rows not in the infile BAT_DPH extension are ignored.
</p>

<p>
The generation of the output file will fail if the file is too large to
fit the available memory.


<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>input [filename]

<dd>Input file name.  The file must contain a BAT_DPH extension. 
<p>
 
<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>Output file name. Precede it with an exclamation point, !, (or \!
on the Unix command line), to overwrite a preexisting file with the
same name (or set the clobber parameter to YES).
<p>

<dt>rows

<dd> The ranges of rows, from the binary table of the BAT_DPH extension
of the original file, to be summed. e.g "1-3, 6-10" 
<p>

<dt>(clobber = "No") [char, "Yes" or "No"]

<dd>Overwrites an existing file if "Yes". clobber is normally set to
"No" and does not overwrite an existing file.
<p>
<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer, 0 - 5]
 
<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard output.
Setting chatter = 5 will produce detailed diagnostic output, otherwise
this task normally does not write any output.
<p>

<dt>(history = NO) [boolean]
 
<dd>If history = YES, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written to
the header of the specified HDU in the output file to record the value
of all the task parameters that were used to produce the output
file.
 
</dl>
 <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
 
Note that when commands are issued on the Unix command line, strings
containing special characters such as '[' or ']' must be enclosed in
single or double quotes.
 
<p>
<i>
The following examples illustrate how the program can be executed to
generate a new FITS file as described above. 
</i>
 
<p>
1. Add DPH_COUNTS in rows 1 and 3 and generate a new BAT_DPH extension
with a single row and a corresponding GTI extension with two rows and
new START and STOP values. The new FITS  file also contains the entire
EBOUNDS extension from the infile.  
<p>
<pre>
batsumdph infile.dph sumfile.dph rows="1,3" clobber="Yes" chatter=1

</pre>

2. Add DPH_COUNTS in row ranges 1-3, 5-7 and generate a new BAT_DPH
extension with a single row and a corresponding GTI extension with the
total number of rows within the specified ranges. Any rows not in the original 
infile are ignored in the summing of the DPH_COUNTS and in the GTI
extension. The START and STOP values are computed from the specified
rows existing in the original infile. As in example one the new FITS
file also contains the entire EBOUNDS extension from the infile.
<p> 
<pre>
batsumdph infile.dph sumfile.dph rows="1-3,5-7" clobber="Yes" chatter=1
</pre>
