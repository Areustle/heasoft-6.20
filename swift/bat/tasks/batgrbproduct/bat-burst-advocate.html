<p>
NOTE: the scripts batgrb<!-- -->product and bat-<!-- -->burst-advocate
are identical.  The first name has been preserved for historical
reasons, and the second name for consistency with the product scripts
of the UVOT and XRT.

<p>
By default it is assumed that the TDRSS position message is present.
This message provides information about the position of the burst and
the initial time interval of the burst.  However, the user can
override these values using command line parameters.  If the RA and
Dec values are set to BLIND, then sky images are made, but no further
analysis is done, and it is up to the user to search the image to find
new sources.

<p>
<b>PREREQUISITES</b> - the user must have the standard FTOOLS (6.0.5
or later) installed and set up.  Also, the Swift BAT Calibration
Database (CALDB) must be installed and set up.  It is assumed that the
input directory is structured as a standard Swift archive, as produced
by the Swift Data Center (SDC) and the HEASARC archive.  The following
subdirectories are required: bat/event, bat/hk, auxil, and tdrss.  The
uvot and xrt subdirectories are not required, although there is no
harm for them to be present. The event by event data should already be
energy-calibrated by either the SDC or running bateconvert manually
(i.e. the PI and ENERGY columns should be filled).

<h2>DETAILS of OPERATION</h2>

<p>
After initialization, bat-burst-advocate begins by extracting the
various burst parameters from the TDRSS burst position message such as
position, trigger start/stop time, and background start/stop time.  If
the TDRSS position message is not available, then the user must supply
these values at the command line.  As noted below, special processing
is done for short bursts.

<p>
A quality map is created from the detector enable/disable map and the
event data itself, by searching for noisy detectors.  Various good
time intervals are created.  Only data from "near" the burst are
retained, defined as within 'tnear' seconds of the burst trigger time
('tnear' is a parameter).  Using this time selector, a new event file
is extracted, covering only the time range of interest.  The mask
weight calculation (ray tracing) is done at this stage using the input
celestial position, after which, the full event file is copied into
separate pre-slew, slew, and post-slew time segments.

<p>
Once the near-trigger event file has been created, a search is
performed for the "best" burst time interval.  This involves searching
light curves of several trial time bin sizes (currently 4 ms, 16 ms,
64 ms, 1 s, and 16 s) for the burst duration, using the Bayesian
blocks algorithm of 'battblocks'.  A set of criteria is used to decide
whether to accept a particular trial duration estimate or not.  If
battblocks failed in any way, then that trial duration estimate is
discarded.  If the trial estimated duration is greater than 2 times
the bin size, and 30% greater than the previous best estimate, then
current trial estimate becomes the new best estimate.  If 'battblocks'
fails to detect the burst with any of the trial binnings, then the
script falls back to the time interval values specified in the TDRSS
message (or the command line).  These time intervals -- T50, T90, and
T100 -- form the best estimated durations of the burst, and are used
to extract "burst" spectra and images.  These intervals are also saved
in the output gti subdirectory as standard GTI files.

<p>
At this stage, detector and sky images are made for the "burst" time
interval, and pre-burst pointed data, if any.  Here "pre-burst" means
any pointed time interval before T100.  If a slew occurs during the
burst, then separate burst images are made from the pre-slew and
post-slew pointings.  Images are never made while the spacecraft is
maneuvering.  Pre-slew and post-slew partial coding maps are also
created, which give an indication of the off-axis exposure level for
these time intervals.

<p>
If a pre-slew image was successfully created, the burst was not an
on-board "image" trigger, and the position came from the TDRSS
position message, then bat-burst-advocate will attempt to refine the
burst position.  The pre-slew sky imge is used to estimate a refined
centroid location.

<p>
Spectra are made for several different time intervals, including T50,
T90, T100, and the peak 1 second flux interval.  The total burst is
also divided into separate pre-slew, slew and post-slew spectra, in
case the user wishes to perform a more refined analysis.  Response
matrices are made for pre-slew and post-slew time intervals.

<p>
Light curves are extracted in several bin sizes and binnings.  For the
total energy range (15-350 keV), light curves are extracted with 4 ms,
64 ms, and 1 s binnings.  Light curves in 4 energy bands are also
created (15-25,25-50,50-100,100-350 keV) with 64 ms and 1 s binnings.
Finally, 1-channel and 4-channel light curves are created using the
Bayesian block time intervals determined by battblocks.

<p>
As a last step, a report file is generated which contains basic
summary information about the burst analysis.  The burst time
intervals and position are reported, as well as the counts fluences in
various bands.

<h2>SUMMARY OUTPUTS</h2>
<p>
Upon finishing, the output directory contains a text file called
<tt>process.log</tt>.  This file contains all the commands executed
and detailed output transcripts.  Users can check this file to: (a)
diagnose problems; and (b) to get ideas on how to use the software to
make their own custom science products.

<p>
The output directory also contains report.txt, which is text file with
a summary report giving basic statistics and factual information about
the trigger that was analyzed.

<p>
The task concludes by printing to the console a detailed inventory of
files it created, including the name and a brief description for each
file.

<h2>OUTPUT RESULTS</h2>

<p>
The output files are arranged by type into several directories. The
following list describes each directory.  Each file name contains
code phrases which are also described.
<dl>

<dt>outdir/lc</dt><dd>Light curves, in standard OGIP light curve
format.  File names are of the form
<tt>swNNNNNNNNNNNb_xchan_bbb.lc</tt>, where NNNNNNNNNNN is the
observation ID.  File names with "1chan" and "4chan" have 1 and 4
energy bins respectively.  The <tt>bbb</tt> portion of the file name
specifies the time binning.  Time binnings can be 1 second ("1s"), 64
millisecond ("64ms") and 4 millisecond ("4ms").  The light curves
cover the full range of event data.  Light curves with "bb" in their
file name are binned with the Bayesian Block algorithm and have
variable time bin sizes.  Light curve rates are based on the mask
weighting algorithm, and have Gaussian-distributed uncertainties.</dd>

<dt>outdir/pha</dt><dd>Spectra and response matrices, in standard OGIP
spectral format.  Spectral file names are of the form
<tt>swNNNNNNNNNNNb_type.pha</tt>, where NNNNNNNNNNN is the observation
ID, and <tt>type</tt> is the time interval for accumulating the
spectrum, as described in the next sentence.  Spectra are computed for
the total burst interval ("total"), the T50/T90 intervals ("t50" and
"t90"), the peak 1 second flux interval ("peak"), and also for the
pre-slew, slew, and post-slew intervals ("preslew", "slew" and
"postslew").  Response matrices are computed for the pre-slew and
post-slew intervals, and have similar file names, except with the
".rsp" suffix.</dd>

<dt>outdir/dpi</dt><dd>Detector images, in DPI format.  Detector image
file names are of the form <tt>swNNNNNNNNNNNb_type_xchan.pha</tt>,
where NNNNNNNNNNN is the observation ID, and <tt>type</tt> is the time
interval for accumulating the spectrum, and <tt>xchan</tt> describes
the energy binning.  Detector images are made in the pre-burst,
pre-slew and post-slew time intervals ("preburst", "preslew" and
"postslew").  Pre-burst means an image created before any detectable
emission.  Images with 1 and 4 energy bins are created.</dd>

<dt>outdir/img</dt><dd>Sky and partial coding images, as standard FITS
image extensions with full World Coordinate System keywords.  Matching
sky images are made for each 1-channel detector image in the
<tt>dpi</tt> directory.  Small "postage-stamp" images are also created
(suffix ".postimg"), centered on a small region around the burst
position.  Partial coding maps are made for the pre-slew and post-slew
intervals, with suffix ".pcodeimg".</dd>

<dt>outdir/gti</dt><dd>Duration information.  Various good time
interval files are generated.  File names with "acs" are
spacecraft-attitude related ("acs_10am", "acs_sett", "acs_slew"
corresponding to the 10-arcmin, settled, and slewing flags,
respectively).  File names with "grb" select events near the GRB
(within 2000 seconds), including the pre-slew, slew and post-slew
intervals.  The "tdrss" file contains time intervals transcribed from
the TDRSS position message.  File names with "bb" are Bayesian blocks
produced with the battblocks task on light curves with different time
binnings.  The file named <tt>swNNNNNNNNNNNb_dur.gti</tt> contains the
estimated burst durations, including T50, T90, T100 and the peak 1
second interval, corresponding to FITS extensions named GTI_T50,
GTI_T90, GTI_TOT, GTI_PEAK.</dd>

<dt>outdir/auxil</dt><dd>Auxiliary information.  The file name with
"qmap" is a detector quality map.  The file with "output.cat" contains
a revised position based on a fit to all pre-slew data.  The
"output.reg" file is a region file suitable for use within DS9 or FV.
The "evaux" file is an auxiliary ray-tracing file.  </dd>

<dt>outdir/events</dt><dd>Event files. Event file names are of the
form <tt>swNNNNNNNNNNNb_type.pha</tt>, where NNNNNNNNNNN is the
observation ID, and <tt>type</tt> is the time interval for
accumulating the events, described in the next sentence.  The event
files correspond to all events near the GRB trigger ("all"), pre-slew
events ("preslew"), slew events ("slew") and post-slew events
("postslew").  All event files in this directory are filtered
according to the 'tnear' parameter.  Since they are re-created each
time the task is run, the files in this directory can be deleted if
desired.  </dd> </dl>

<h2>CREATING CUSTOM SPECTRA or LIGHTCURVES</h2>

<p>
As detailed above, this task creates several standard spectra and
light curves which will often be useful to the observer.  However, it
is understood that the user may also want to make spectra or light
curve products with different options from the standard ones.  This
section gives some suggestions of how this could be done.
</p>

<p>The user is also urged to read the sections of the BAT software
documentation on making spectra and light crves for more detailed
information and caveats.  Both BAT spectra and light curves are
created with the 'batbinevt' task, but there are several other
procedures that must be completed in order to have scientifically
meaningful results.  Recommended analysis techniques may change over
time, so the user is urged to periodically consult the software
documentation to be sure they are using the most up-to-date
techniques.
</p>

<p>
A typical BAT spectrum can be created with the following 'batbinevt'
command:
</p>
<pre>

  batbinevt infile='outdir/events/swNNNNNNNNNNNb_all.evt' \
     outfile='custom_spectrum.pha' outtype=PHA timedel=0 timebinalg=u \
     energybins='CALDB:80' detmask='outdir/auxil/swNNNNNNNNNNNb_qmap.fits' \
     ecol=ENERGY weighted=YES outunits='RATE' 

</pre>
<p>
In this command, 'outdir' is the output directory as given on the
batgrbproduct command line; and 'NNNNNNNNNN' is the Swift observation
number (which should also be the name of the 'indir', if the data came
from the archive).  Of course the user is free to choose different
time filtering or energy bins, as described in the BAT software
documentation; this example uses the standard 80 energy bins.
<b>IMPORTANT NOTES:</b> there are additional corrections that must be
applied to a spectrum before it is scientifically meaningful.  Please
read the BAT software documentation before doing spectral fitting.
</p>

<p>
A custom light curve file can be constructed in a similar way:
</p>
<pre>

  batbinevt infile='outdir/events/swNNNNNNNNNNNb_all.evt' \
     outfile='custom_lightcurve_1s.lc' outtype=LC timedel=1 timebinalg=u \
     energybins='15-350' detmask='outdir/auxil/swNNNNNNNNNNNb_qmap.fits' \
     ecol=ENERGY weighted=YES outunits='RATE' 

</pre>
<p>
Please see above for the meanings of 'outdir' and 'NNNNNNNNNN'.  Of
course the user is free to choose different time or energy bins, as
described in the BAT software documentation; this example uses 1
second bins in the 15-350 keV range.  Please consult the BAT software
documentation for more information about constructing meaningful light
curves.
</p>

<h2>SHORT BURSTS</h2>

<p>
For short burst triggers (triggers shorter than or equal to 64
milliseconds), the BAT flight software reports the incorrect burst
trigger time in the BAT TDRSS position message (the keyword containing
the trigger start time is named TRIGTIME).  The value in the telemetry
is the <i>start</i> of a 320 millisecond interval which contains the
<i>end</i> of the trigger interval.  Thus, in principle, the end of a
short burst trigger could have fallen anywhere within a 320
millisecond interval starting at TRIGTIME.

<p>
For short bursts this behavior can cause problems.  First of all, the
automatic burst-finding algorithm in battblocks cannot always find
short, faint bursts, which causes the algorithm to fall back to the
time intervals reported in the position message.  Since these time
intervals are incorrect, the result can appear to be a non-detection.

<p>
There are several ways to work around this problem.  The first way is
to examine the light curve and manually adjust the trigger start and
stop time to cover the true interval of the burst (using the trigtime
and trigstop parameters to this task).  

<p>
There are also two automatic ways to work around this problem, using
the 'shortfix' parameter.  If 'shortfix' is set to 'scaledmap', this
task will use the BAT "scaled map" product to determine the burst
intervals.  The scaled map is a detector plane image which contains
the exact time intervals of the burst trigger with no ambiguity.  If
'shortfix' is set to 'expand' then the trigger interval will be
automatically expanded to at least 320 milliseconds so that the true
burst interval will be included.  This method unavoidably adds extra
noise to the analysis, so it should be avoided if possible.  The
default value of 'scaledmap,expand' causes this task to first check
for a scaled map, and only if one is not present, use the expand
method.

<p>
Users should be aware that the TRIGTIME keyword in all of the output
results will contain the <i>adjusted</i> trigger start time and
<i>not</i> the telemetered value.  This is true if the trigger time is
specified on the command line using the trigtime/trigstop parameters,
or if it is adjusted automatically via the 'shortfix' parameter.


<h2>ERRORS</h2>

<p>
Most error conditions are reported on the console.  Please note that
not all bursts are the same, and the Swift spacecraft response is not
the same.  For example, there may not be a slew to the burst, in which
case, there won't be "slew" and "post-slew" spectra or images.  Also,
if the burst does not extend past the end of the slew (if there is
one), there will not be a post-slew spectrum.  The task will report
these failures to produce spectra and images as errors, but they are
benign.

<p>
For certain kinds of bursts -- namely short hard bursts -- the task is
not always able to find the time interval of the burst.  In those
cases, the task falls back to the trigger interval reported in the
telemetry (or, the adjusted trigger time as described above).

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2> <dl>

<dt>indir [string]

<dd>Input directory containing Swift data.  This directory must have
the standard Swift archive layout.  Files in the input directory will
not be modified.

<dt>outdir [string]

<dd>Output directory which will contain the processing results.  The
output files are organized by file type: events, pha (spectra), lc
(light curves), gti (good time intervals), auxil (miscellaneous).
Also a summary report is created (report.txt), and a detailed
processing log (process.log).

<dt>ra = "BAT" [string]

<dd>RA of the source (degrees).  A value of "BAT" or "XRT" means that
the BAT or XRT TDRSS position should be used.  A value of "BLIND"
means to do the analysis blind, without concentrating on any one position
in the field of view.  When "BLIND", then the
trigtime/trigstop/backstrt/backstop parameters must be specified.
<p>

<dt>dec = "BAT" [string].  

<dd>Declination of the source (degrees).  See "ra".
<p>

<dt>trigtime = 0.0 [real]

<dd>Start time of the foreground interval containing the burst in
mission elapsed time.  A value of 0 indicates to use the times from
the TDRSS position message, and a non-zero value overrides the TDRSS
message.
<p>

<dt>trigstop = 0.0 [real]

<dd>Stop time of the foreground interval containing the burst in
mission elapsed time.  A value of 0 indicates to use the times from
the TDRSS position message, and a non-zero value overrides the TDRSS
message.
<p>

<dt>backstrt = 0.0 [real]

<dd>Start time of the background interval before the burst in mission
elapsed time.  A value of 0 indicates to use the times from the TDRSS
position message, and a non-zero value overrides the TDRSS
message.
<p>

<dt>backstop = 0.0 [real]

<dd>Stop time of the background interval before the burst in mission
elapsed time.  A value of 0 indicates to use the times from the TDRSS
position message, and a non-zero value overrides the TDRSS
message.
<p>

<dt>shortfix = "scaledmap,expand" [string]

<dd>Specify a method to work around the problem of incorrect BAT
trigger times for short bursts (see detailed description above).  The
value should be either "scaledmap" (use BAT scaled map to determine
burst interval), "expand" (expand the short burst interval to at least
320 milliseconds), or "scaledmap,expand" (try both methods).
<p>

<dt>tnear = 2000.0 [real]

<dd>Specifies approximate time interval of interest near the time of
the trigger, defined as TRIGTIME-tnear to TRIGTIME+tnear.
<p>

<dt>tbinmax = 1000.0 [real]

<dd>Specifies the largest trial time bin size to use while searching
for the burst duration.  See above for the list of currently-used
trial time bin sizes.
<p>

<dt>date_obs = "INDEF" [string]

<dd>User override of the DATE-OBS keyword in event files.  This
parameter is useful if the input data has an invalid date, like
'2001-01-01' or 'TBD'.  In that case, set date_obs='YYYY-MM-DD' where
YYYY-MM-DD is the date of the observation.  A value of "INDEF"
indicates that the DATE-OBS keyword should not be changed (although it
will still be checked for validity).
<p>

<dt>(tbkgsub = YES) [boolean]

<dd>If set, then the task instructs battblocks to perform background
subtraction during the "background" intervals before and after the GRB
before estimating the T50/T90 durations.  If not set, then it is
assumed that the light curves are already background subtracted (via
mask weighting).  Caveats: setting tbkgsub=YES may cause problems if
the light curve doesn't have a true quiescent background interval;
setting tbkgsub=NO may cause problems if the light curve is not fully
background subtracted.
<p>

<dt>(pcodethresh = 0.0) [real]

<dd>Minimum partial coding threshold.  Set this value to a number
greater than 0 in order to exclude noisy data when a GRB passes 
out of the BAT field of view.  A value of 0.0 includes all data;
A value of 1.0 includes only data when the source is in the (small)
BAT fully coded field of view.
<p>

<dt>(imgpcodethresh = 0.05) [real]

<dd>Minimum partial coding threshold for image analysis.  Set this 
number to a value greater than 0.0 to exclude noisy pixels at the 
edges of the BAT image.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Currently ignored.
<p>

<dt>(history = YES) [boolean]

<dd>Currently ignored.
<p>

</dl>
