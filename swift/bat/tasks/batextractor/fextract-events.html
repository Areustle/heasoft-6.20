<h2>NAME</h2>

fextract-events - Fast event filtering, similar to extractor

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>fextract-events filename eventsout timefile= regionfile= ...</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
The fextract-events task does basic event filtering.  It could be
considered a stripped down version of 'extractor' which does only
event filtering (no images, spectra or light curves), but it does it
many times faster.

<p>
fextract-events can perform temporal or spatial filtering using
good time interval files (GTIs) and/or spatial region files, 
respectively.  Also, basic column filtering by command-line
interval ranges are supported as in 'extractor'.

<p>
fextract-events does not accept all the parameters of extractor (in
particular, not the spectrum, light curve, or image parameters), but
the event filtering parameters are accepted, and have the same names.

<p>
Time filtering is performed by using GTIs. The GTIs from all the input
'timefile's (if any) are ORed together; the GTIs from all the input
event files are ORed together; and then finally, these two sets are
ANDed together to form the master time filter.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>filename [string]</dt>

<dd>The  input  event  filename.  If this starts with "@" then it is
assumed to be an ascii file containing a list of event files  to
be  read.  Interval  filters  can be specified by appending them
inside [] on the end of this parameter. For instance, to  accept
only  events  with  PHA lying between 7 and 30 the filename will
be specified by "infile.evt[pha=7:30]". If a list  of  filenames
is  given  (using  "@")  then  the  interval filtering should be
specified on the input paramater, not on  the  individual  event
filenames.  Successive  interval  filters should be separated by
spaces or commas.  Interval filters must correspond to a column
name in the input event file.
</dd>

<dt>eventsout</dt>

<dd>The name for the output events file.
</dd>

<dt>(regionfile = "NONE") [string]
</dt>

<dd>The name of a spatial region file, or NONE for no spatial
filtering.  The region coordinates are assumed to be given by the
xcolf and ycolf parameters.
</dd>

<dt>(timefile = "NONE") [string]
</dt>

<dd>The name of a temporal good time interval file, or NONE for no
temporal filtering.  Note that there is no 'gtinam' parameter; you
should specify the extension name directly in the timefile parameter, for
example as "timefile='mytime.gti[STDGTI]'".
</dd>

<dt>(xcolf = "DETX") [string]
</dt>

<dd>
The  name  of  the  column used for the X coordinate when region
filtering.
</dd>

<dt>(ycolf = "DETY") [string]
</dt>

<dd>
The  name  of  the  column used for the Y coordinate when region
filtering.
</dd>

<dt>(tcol = "TIME") [string]
</dt>

<dd>
The name of the column used for the time of the event.
</dd>

<dt>(events = "EVENTS") [string]
</dt>
<dd>
The name of the EVENTS extension in the input files.
</dd>

<dt>(gti = "STDGTI") [string]
</dt>
<dd>
The name of the GTI extension in the input event files.
</dd>

<dt>(copyall = NO) [boolean]
</dt>
<dd>
Not currently used.
</dd>

<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If the output file already exists, then setting "clobber = yes" will cause it to be overwritten.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 2) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Amount of verbosity of the task.  For chatter=0, no output is
printed.  For chatter=5, debugging output is
printed.
<p>

<dt>(history = YES) [boolean]

<dd>If history = YES, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written to
the header of the specified HDU in the output file to record the value
of all the task parameters that were used to produce the output
file.

</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>

1. Perform filtering on theevent files listed in the ASCI file
infile.lis.  The temporal filters listed in the GTI file select.gti,
and the spatial filters listed in the region file select.reg are
applied.  The output is sent to output.evt.

<pre>
  fextract-events @infile.lis output.evt timefile=select.gti regionfile=select.reg
