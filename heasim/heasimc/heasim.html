<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

  <p>
    Heasim is a multi-mission high-energy astrophysics simulation
    tool. Heasim utilizes a pseudo Monte-Carlo approach that
    redistributes the source photons in position and energy according
    to the input files appropriate to the chosen telescope/detector
    system. The output is a FITS event file, from which data products
    may be extracted and analyzed using, e.g., XSELECT, XSPEC, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    The parameters mission and instrume are for specifying the mission
    name and the instrument names for that mission. The specific
    characteristics of the supported instruments (e.g. , pixel size,
    field-of-view, etc.) are collected in the mission database file
    (parameter mdbfile). The parameters rapoint, decpoint define the
    pointing direction, and the roll parameter the rotation angle (all
    in decimal degrees). The exposure time in seconds is entered in as
    the parameter exposure. The source(s) position; and spectral,
    spatial, and temporal characteristics are input via the source
    definition file (parameter insrcdeffile). Point spread function,
    vignetting, spectral response, effective area and internal
    background for each detector are input using the parameters
    psffile, vigfile, rmffile, arffille, and intbackfile,
    respectively.  The sky background may be calculated using the
    skyback tool and the output files from skyback may be input to
    heasim. The parameter psbackfile accepts a file containing a list
    of the resolved background point sources as calculated and output
    by skyback. The parameter pszbackfile accepts a file that lists
    the point source intrinsic redshifts and absorptions for these
    same sources. The parameter difbackfile accepts the file that
    lists a single diffuse background extended source as calculated
    and output by skyback. The simulation may be split into multiple
    subexposures by setting the flagsubex parameter to yes, and the
    subexpsosure parameter to a value that differs from
    exposure. Resampling of event locations from sky pixels onto
    larger detector pixels is controlled by the resample
    parameter. Basic event pileup may be simulated with the dtpileup
    timescale parameter in units of seconds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Heasim calculates simulated events for each input source in the
    source definition file (and background) with the following
    steps. (1) The absorbed input spectrum (in photons cm-2 s-1 vs
    keV) based on the input spectral model or user spectrum file is
    calculated in each energy bin in the arf file. (2) This is then
    converted to cts/bin vs bin on this input energy grid by
    multiplying by the exposure time and effective area. (3) The sum
    over all bins yields the total number of events. For each source,
    the code loops over each input energy bin, and over the counts in
    each bin (4) probabilistically assigning a sky position to each
    event according to the source spatial distribution. This
    distribution may be determined either by a model or by an input
    image (or subimage). (5) An event may be discarded based on the
    vignetting, and (6) "scattered" by the PSF. (7) Events are
    discarded if located outside the FOV, and (8) assigned final
    discrete sky coordinates that are resampled within detector pixels
    unless resampling is switched off. For each energy bin, (9) the
    rmf is used to redistribute the input energy and assign output PI
    values for each photon not discarded due to vignetting or falling
    outside the FOV. These events are then (10) assigned times
    according to the source temporal characteristics (constant,
    periodic, or burst). Sky background sources, i.e. from the output
    of skyback, are identically processed. Internal background events
    from the input internal background spectrum, following rescaling
    to the detector area and observation exposure time, are assigned
    random detector locations and times within the exposure. Events
    from all sources and from the internal background are merged and
    sorted on time, with an option to identify pileup.  If the
    simulation is split into subexpsoures, this procedure is repeated
    for each subexposure, with the time-sorting, pileup calculation,
    and final output completed within each interval to reduce memory
    usage.
  </p>

      <p>
    The "source definition file" allows one to specify the spatial,
    spectral, and temporal characteristics of the source(s) to be
    simulated. This file is always required. This is an ascii file
    where each row contains parameters, separated by commas, and is
    dedicated to a single source. The format of each row is:

ra, dec, NH, spec_mod, spec_par, flux, bandpass, filename, format,
units, source_specs

    where ra and dec identifies the position of the source to simulate
    (degrees), and NH is the column density. The spectral
    characteristics may be specified in two different ways: (a) as a
    single component spectral model with one spectral parameter, and
    flux in a specified energy band, using the parameters spec_mod,
    spec_par, flux, and bandpass; or, alternatively (b) a spectrum can
    be input using the parameters filename, format, and units (see
    description in the user guide).  All of these parameters are
    required, except for source_specs -- a string that may be added to
    specify the timing or spatial characteristics for sources. The
    specific strings are: pulse(period, pulse_frac); burst(tburst,
    risetime, decaytime, burstratio); extmod(beta, beta, core_radius,
    ellipticity, pos_angle, Rmin, Rmax); extmod(ellipse, ellipticity,
    pos_angle, Rmin, Rmax); extmod(power, slope, Rmin, Rmax);
    extmod(gauss, fwhm_x, fwhm_y, pos_angle); extmod(flat, Rmin,
    Rmax); image(filename, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax).  These options are
    described in detail in the heasim user guide.
</p>

<p>
Setting the flagsubex parameter to "yes" and the subexposure parameter
to a value different than the exposure parameter may be used to reduce
memory usage by splitting the simulation into several separate,
consecutive sub-simulations.  In this case heasim processes the
simulated events within the time specified in the subexposure, writes
these events to the output file and proceeds to the next
subexposure. If the subexposure is equal to the exposure parameter all
events are processed together (even for flagsubex=yes). If subexposure
> exposure, the subexposure durations are "optimized" to have less
than 500,000 counts per subexposure. By default, the parameters
flagsubex and subexposure are set to allow the "optimization" mode
(flagsubex=yes and subexposure =1.0e9). This option cannot be used to
simulate variable sources.
</p>

<p>
  If the skipfov parameter is set to "no", events outside of the
  field-of-view as defined by the mdb file are not discarded. 
</p>

  <p>
    The heasim output events file contains the following columns: the
     time of the event, TIME, the sky coordinates, X and Y, the energy
     channel PI, and a flag set to 1 if the event is piled up (and 0
     otherwise), PILEUP.

</p>

<p>
<dt>(pszbackfile = NONE) [string] 
<dd>The filename with the auxiliary data of the resolved background point sources. 
The file contains redshift and intrinsic absorption column density of the resolved

=1.0e9) ([yes]/no). Optional. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(subexposure = 1.0e9) [double]</dt>
<dd>Subexposure time in seconds. If flagsubex is set to yes, this parameter is used 
to effectively split the simulation into multiple observations with this duration. 
If greater than the exposure parameter, the subexposure duration is "optimized" 
such that there are no more than 500,000 estimated counts per subexspoure.  By default, the parameters flagsubex and subexposure are
