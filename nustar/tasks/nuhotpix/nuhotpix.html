<h2>NAME</h2>
nuhotpix --  Search for hot and flickering pixels in NuSTAR event files
<h2>USAGE</h2>
<tt>nuhotpix infile outfile [parameter = < value >]</tt>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

'nuhotpix' searches for anomalous (hot and flickering) pixels by applying statistical tests to the NuSTAR event file. 
For each detector of the Focal Plane Module, and for each time interval defined by the input parameter 'binsize', the events 
are binned into images. For each image, hot/flickering pixel are identified by comparing the counts in each pixel 
to the mean background counts.
<p>
First, for each pixel, the probability for its counts to be a Poisson fluctuation of the background is computed using the incomplete 
Gamma function Gamma(c,b), where (c) are the counts in the pixel and (b) is the background evaluated using the mean 
of the total counts on the detector image. The parameter 'impfac' allows the user to rescale the background level. If the pixel 
probability is lower than a Poisson probability threshold (set through the parameter 'logpos'), the pixel is considered a 
hot/flickering pixel candidate. To confirm the hot/flickering pixel candidates, their counts are compared to the mean counts of the surrounding 
pixels in a square cell. 
By setting the cell size (parameter 'cellsize') to the order of the PSF core, it is possible to discriminate a hot/flickering pixel from a pixel 
of the X-ray source.
<p>
As a second step, by setting the parameter 'cleanflick' to "yes" (default), hot/flickering pixels are searched using a background 
estimated locally in its surrounding pixels contained in a cell with size defined by the parameter 'cellsize'. If the local background is zero, 
the pixel is flagged as hot/flickering if the number 
of counts is larger than a threshold value (set by the parameter 'bthresh'). In this second step, the hot/flickering pixels search 
may be iterated by setting the parameter 'iterate' to "yes". 
<p>
To flag events, the 'nuhotpix' module updates the 'STATUS' column of the event file (see 'nuflagbad' help file). The format of 
this column is a 16-bit binary number specifying the quality of the flagging.
<p>
The task also flags events if any of the 8 neighborhood pixels falls on a hot/flickering pixel. The position of 
these neighbor pixels is stored in a new column, named 'HOTPOS', added by the task. The format of this column is a 8-bit binary number. 
<p>
The values of the 'STATUS' column used by 'nuhotpix' is the following:
<blockquote>
    Events STATUS flags
<blockquote>
<li>        b0000000000100000 Event falls in a hot/flickering pixel 
<li>        b0000000001000000 Event has a neighbor hot/flickering pixel
</blockquote>        
</blockquote>    
<p>
The list of hot/flickering pixels is stored in the four 'BADPIX' extensions, one for each of the 
four detectors, of the output event file. 
Optionally, if requested by the user through the parameter 'outhpfile', the
hot/flickering pixels list is also written in a separate output file. 
<p>
The 'BADPIX' extensions is updated with the positional and temporal information of the hot/flikering pixels. The 
start and end time values of the time interval where the pixel is hot/flickering is stored in the two columns 'TIME' and 'TIME_STOP'.
The 16-bit binary number column 'BADFLAG' (see 'nuflagbad' help file) is updated by 'nuhotpix' as follows:
<blockquote>  
    Hot/flickering pixels BADFLAG values
<blockquote>  
<li>   b0000000000100000 Event falls in a hot/flickering pixel 
</blockquote>        
</blockquote>
