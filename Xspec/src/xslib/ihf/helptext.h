"The Interactive Help Facility (IHF) provides a topical help interface \n\
similar to the VMS help facility.\n\
\n\
Enter the shortest, unique, case-insensitive match for the subtopic you would\n\
like to see.  Multiple subtopics can be entered on the command line.\n\
\n\
To ascend the topic tree, type <return> at the 'help>' prompt.  Ascending \n\
from the uppper-most topic will cause you to exit from the IHF.\n\
\n\
To exit the IHF at any level, type the appropriate end of file character for\n\
the system you are using.  For unix users, this will be '<control> d'.  VMS \n\
users should use '<control> z'.\n\
\n\
Unix users may also use the command line editing, history recall and command\n\
line completion features of GNU's readline package.  The up-arrow and \n\
down-arrow keys will allow you to cycle through previous commands, and the\n\
<tab> key will complete your partially typed subtopic on the command line in\n\
the same way the t-shell does.  Typing '<meta> ?' (i.e. '<esc> ?') will \n\
produce a list of possible completions.\n\
