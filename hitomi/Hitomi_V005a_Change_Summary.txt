 * Mission Applications:

   - aharfgen , ahsxtarfgen , hxirspeffimg
      New parameter: polydeg (string): polynomial order for the fitting. 
      For the HXI, the DEFAULT value sets the polynomial order to 5.  For 
      the SXI and SXS, the DEFAULT value sets the polynomial order to an 
      internal test for the best polynomial order.  Other allowed values 
      are 1 to 5 for the HXI and 1 to 10 for the SXI and SXS.
   
   - ahsxtarfgen
      Behavior change: the default behavior is changed since the 
      polynomial order to provide a stable fit solution is tested internally
      with a minimization technique. The parameter value polydeg determines 
      whether or not the routine should use the default behavior.

   - xrtraytrace 
      Bug-fix: correct the behavior of decreasing area with increasing 
      number of input photons for large region.  This affects the raytracing 
      output when run with flat or beta model in conjunction with very 
      large regions (~above 12 arcmin) and number of events larger than
      200000 on axis.     

 * SXI
   - sxipi 
      Bug-fix : in a debug statement array out of range for window mode data 
      when reading CTI from CALDB giving seg fault. No effect on the actual
      calculation but just on the print statements

 *SXS 
   - mxstime
      Bug-fix : fine gti overlapping are checked using the pulselength and 
      compare the afterglow length.  For files where the start of the mxs is 
      outside of the start of file the code was not using the correct 
      pulselength from the last row. This is only affected if the afterglow 
      flag is set to yes.
