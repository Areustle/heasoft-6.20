<h2>NAME</h2>

cams2det - Calculate offsets and rotations in 
HXI coordinates using CAMS telemetry input


<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>cams2det infile1 infile2 outfile instrume</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
 
'cams2det' calculates HXI coordinate system 
offsets and 
rotations due to the wobbling of the Extended Optical Bench.  
The two input files are 
telemetry FITS files from each of CAMS1 and CAMS2.  The output is a single 
FITS file with new columns containing the offsets in HXI RAW coordinates and the sine and cosine of the 
rotation 
angle. The output file can 
be converted into an attitude file by running the task 'det2att2' on the output file.  
'cams2det' must be run separately on each of the two HXI units HXI1 and HXI2.

<p>
The routine
matches the input TIME columns of infile1 and infile2.
When a match is found, the routine uses data from
both CAMS units to derive the offsets and rotation angle. 
If no match is found within a given tolerance (fixed in the software to 1 ms), 
the 
offset for
that row is calculated based on a single CAMS unit and the rotation angle is 
set equal
to zero.

<p>
The following columns are written to the output offset file:
<p>
TIME [s] is derived from the TIME column present in the two input CAMS data files.<br>
DELTARAWX/DELTARAWY [pixels] is the component in the HXI RAW X/Y direction
of the offset required to correct for the wobble of the HXI extended optical 
bench.<br>
COSANGLE/SINANGLE is the cosine/sine of the rotation angle required to 
correct for the wobble 
    of the HXI extended optical bench.<br>
X1/X2 is the motion in 
the X-direction in the local coordinate system of the CAMS1/CAMS2
unit. It is copied directly from the 'X' column in the input file 
infile1/infile2<br>
Y1/Y2 is the motion 
in the Y-direction in the local coordinate system of the CAMS1/CAMS2
unit. It is copied directly from the 'Y' column in the input file 
infile1/infile2  <br>
JUMPX1/X2 is the difference between successive values of X1/X2.<br>
JUMPY1/Y2 is the difference between successive values of Y1/Y2.<br>
QUALITY1/QUALITY2 is copied directly from the QUALITY column of infile1/infile2.<br>
XDISTANCE/YDISTANCE [mm] is the X/Y distance between the CAMS units 
(X2 - X1)/(Y2 - Y1). This is 
calculated as an intermediate step in deriving the offset and rotation angle. <br>
DELTASATX/DELTASATY [mm] is the offset equivalent to DELTARAWX/DELTASATY, but 
measured in the
satellite coordinate system (SAT).<br>
'BAD_UNITS' indicates which CAMS unit has valid data. If this equals to 0, both 
CAMS 
units have valid data, if it equals to 1, only CAMS2 has valid data and if 
equals 2, only CAMS1 has valid data.<br>
CALC_QUALITY is generated internally to the code and is used to indicate one or
more of the following situations.
<dd><br>
CALC_QUALITY = 0: successful calculation of offsets 
and rotation (twist) angle.<br>
CALC_QUALITY = 1: the rotation angle is not calculated because one CAMS unit 
has no 
  good data. <br>
  CALC_QUALITY = 2: tiny twist angle fixed to cos(twist) = +-1, sin(twist) = 0
  due to problem in the calculation of the twist angle.<br>
  CALC_QUALITY = 4: no calculation
of offsets or twist angle possible.</dd>
