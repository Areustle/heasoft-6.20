instrument/detector-independent applications (tasks).

ahtrendtemp: extend the frequency vs. temperature CALDB file used to calibrate
             the on-board clock when GPS is not synchronized

ahmktim: use the frequency vs. temperature CALDB file to calibrate L32TI and
         TIME, generating the TIM file needed for time assignment

ahtime: use the TIM file to assign times to HK or science data

ahtimeconv: convert times between UTC, TAI, and TT
