<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
'aharfgen' is a script that runs the tools 'ahsxtarfgen' and
'hxirspeffimg'. When 'aharfgen' is used to run 'ahsxtarfgen', an
ancillary response function (ARF) file for the SXS + SXT-S (parameter
'instrume=SXS') or the SXI + SXT-I ('instrume=SXI') combination is
created. When 'aharfgen' is used to run 'hxirspeffimg', a spectral
response matrix (.RSP file) for the HXI1 + HXT ('instrume=HXI1') or
HXI2 + HXT ('instrume=HXI2') combination is created. 'aharfgen' takes
as input an exposure map file created by the tool 'ahexpmap'. The
exposure map file contains information about the satellite attitude
and variation in the telescope optical axis pointing, as well as
spatial effective exposure time information. A standard SAO region
file input can be used to specify the region in RA/DEC or DET coordinates for
which the output ARF or RSP files are created (see 'regmode' and 'regionfile'
parameter). If the region is in RA/DEC coordinates, the script then creates a number of selection regions in
the DET coordinate system corresponding to discrete satellite
attitude intervals (or histogram bins) described in the exposure map
file. The options for specifying the spatial distribution of the of
X-ray source, are (1) point source ('sourcetype=point'), (2) uniform
source ('sourcetype=flatcircle') with a set radius (see 'flatradius'
parameter), (3) beta model ('sourcetype=betamodel'; see 'betapars'
parameter), and (4) input image ('sourcetype='image'). The image
option, useful for extended sources, uses an input image file to
create a photon event list by the simulation tool 'heasim'. This
event list is subsequently input into the raytracing code. The input
image file could be made from data from a different mission, or from a
model. The source position is input using the 'source_ra' and
'source_dec' parameters.
</p>
<p>
'aharfgen' runs the raytracing tool 'xrtraytrace', using information
about the source and region selection to simulate photon paths through
the X-ray telescope. The photon paths, or events, along with the
source and region information, are passed onto 'ahsxtarfgen' or
'hxieffrspimg' in order to enable the telescope effective area to be
calculated. Detector efficiencies are calculated in 'ahsxtarfgen' and
'hxieffrspimg', not in 'aharfgen'.  The raytracing file is saved and
can be used again to run either 'ahsxtarfgen' or 'hxieffrspimg'
without running 'xrtraytrace'. When 'aharfgen' is run, and it finds
that a raytracing file with the requested file name already exists,
'aharfgen' skips running the raytracing code again, and instead
pass on the existing event file onto 'ahsxtarfgen' or
'hxirspeffimg'. Running the raytracing code is very time-intensive so
this feature avoids unnecessarily long run times whenever possible.
The event file from previous runs of the raytracing may be  used if the arf is recalculated
using a different binning (the binning is defined by rmf), 
different region and whether or not the auxiliary transmission file is used.
</p>
<p>
The number of photons injected into the raytracing code determines the statistical 
accuracy of the effective area and detector efficiencies. 
This number is controlled by the
parameter 'numphoton'. The total number of photons injected into the
raytracing code is determined by an algorithm that takes into account
the relative time intervals for each attitude bin as given in the
first extension of the exposure map file. Each row in the first
extension of the exposure map file corresponds to one attitude
bin. The value of the parameter 'numphoton' corresponds roughly to the
number of raytracing photons allocated to each attitude bin per energy
grid point. If any attitude bin has a time interval significantly
larger than the average time interval, 'aharfgen' allocates
additional raytracing photons to that attitude position. Note that the
raytracing is performed on a coarse energy grid for modeling the
spatial distribution of photons, which has a weak energy
dependence. The final effective area calculated by 'aharfgen' combines
these coarse-grid results with some pre-calculated raytracing results
that were obtained on a fine energy grid that captures all of the
atomic physics at a level of detail sufficient for the SXS.
</p>
<p>
As a rough guide, one should aim for a minimum total of 3 million
photons over the whole energy range, and numphoton can be estimated by
numphoton ~ (total number of photons/number of attitude bins/X), where
X~16 for SXS or SXI over the energy range 0.4-15 keV, and X~270 for
the HXI over the energy range 4-70 keV. The run time for the
raytracing code is approximately 1 minute per 100,000 photons. The
energy range for which 'aharfgen' calculates the ARF or RSP files is
selectable by the user, and ranges wider than the nominal ranges just
mentioned may be specified. For the SXS the energy range can span 0.03
to 30 keV; and, for the SXI, 0.03 to 24 keV. For the HXI the energy
range can span 2 to 120 keV. However the calibration outside of the
nominal energy ranges is not reliable, so it is not recommended to
choose wider ranges the nominal ones, which would also result in a
substantial increase in the runtime.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<p>
<dt>xrtevtfile [filename]</dt>
<dd>Name of event/history file created by the raytracing program
  'xrtraytrace', and used by 'aharfgen'. If xrtevtfile does not exist
  'aharfgen' creates it by running 'xrtraytrace'.  If xrtevtfile is
  the name of an existing file that was previously created by
  'aharfgen', this file is used instead of creating a new one. </dd>

<dd>RA (degrees) of the X-ray source for which the ARF is to be
created. For 'sourcetype=flatcircle' or 'betamodel', it is the RA of

telescope optical axis, are to be directly obtained from the exposure
map file.</dd>

<dd>Declination (DEC, degrees) of the X-ray source for which the ARF
is to be created. For 'sourcetype=flatcircle' or 'betamodel', it is

be used to shorten the run time, if a restricted energy range is
sufficient for the application. The third and fourth numbers in the

<dd>The value of the parameter 'numphoton' corresponds roughly to the
number of raytracing photons allocated to each attitude histogram bin

described by the "beta model" (see 'betapars' parameter). (4) Image: A
FITS image file (in RA/DEC coordinates) is used to create a photon
event list using the simulation code 'heasim'. This event list is
subsequently input into the raytracing code by 'aharfgen'. The input

To apply the auxiliary transmission users has either to input a file or set to CALDB. 
</dd>
</p>

<dd> 
 This parameter is only valid for the HXI not for the SXI or SXS.
 Define the lower threshold for writing non-zero matrix elements in the HXI output RSP file. 
  If the matrix elements value is less than the value of rmfthresh then that matrix element is et to 0.
 It is not recommended to increase the value rmfthresh above the default 
 value as it may reduce the compressibility of the output, making the matrix too large for the software to handle.

<dt>(polydeg = "DEFAULT") [string]</dt>
<dd>Polydeg defines the polynomial order for the fitting. The allowed values are: DEFAULT and 
1 to 5 for the HXI and 1 to 10 for the SXS and SXI. For the HXI the DEFAULT value of polydeg is

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<ol>
<p>
1. Make an ARF file for a point source in the SXI given the RA/DEC
region selection file src_sky.reg, and an exposure map file
src_expmap.fits made by the tool 'ahexpmap'. An example of the contents of the region file src_sky.reg is:
</p>
<tt>
# Region file format: DS9 version 4.1 </br>
global color=green dashlist=8 3 width=1 font="helvetica 10 normal" select=1 high </br>
lite=1 dash=0 fixed=0 edit=1 move=1 delete=1 include=1 source=1 wcs=wcs </br>
fk5
circle(140.0,35.0,150.0")
</tt>

<p>
In this example the source RA and DEC coordinates are 140 and 35
degrees respectively, and the extraction region is a circle centered
on the source, with a radius of 150 arcsec. The parameters 'source_ra'
and 'source_dec' that should be entered are equal to the values of the
corresponding source coordinates in the region file. For the SXS or
SXI, 'ahsxtarfgen' (called by aharfgen) only uses the energy grid in
'rmffile' and not the actual matrix data, so the particular response
matrix (RMF) specified for 'rmffile' is not important. The ARF made by
'ahsxtarfgen' is calculated on the exact energy grid in 'rmffile'.
</p>

<pre>
aharfgen  xrtevtfile=src_1_raytrace.fits 
	  source_ra=140.0
	  source_dec=35.0

	  numphoton=10000
	  sourcetype=point
</pre>
</ol>
<p>The example run produces the output following files: (1)
src_1_arf.fits; (2) aharfgen_region.lis (contains the names of region
files made in detector coordinates: src_1_arf.arfregion0.reg to
src_1_arf.arfregionN.reg where N is the number of attitude histogram
bins in the exposure map file, extension 1; (3) src_1_raytrace.fits.

<h2>KNOWN BUGS</h2>

<p>
If 'aharfgen' is run with 'sourcetye=image', the number of photons generated from the image in the initial event list should be equal to the input parameter 'numphoton', but this is not the case. A way to mitigate the effects of this bug is to run 'aharfgen' with the intended value of 'numphoton' and note in the screen output the number of actual source events generated by the tool 'heasim.' Then interrupt 'aharfgen' and run it again with a new value of 'numphoton' set to the original value squared divided by the actual number of events generated by heasim.
