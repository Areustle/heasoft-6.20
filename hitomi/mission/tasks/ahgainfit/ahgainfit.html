<h2>NAME</h2>

ahgainfit -- Calculate the time-dependent energy gain corrections
using known calibration lines


<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>ahgainfit infile outfile</tt> 

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
'ahgainfit' calculates time-dependent energy gain corrections by
comparing the theoretical and observed energies of a calibration line
or line complex. For each run of the task, only one line may be
specified to calculate the gain correction (see parameter
'linetocorrect'). 'ahgainfit' is a general task used directly
in the scripts 'sxigainfit', 'hxigainfit', 'sgdgainfit' for the SXI
HXI, and SGD respectively. For the SXS, the 'sxsgain' tasks uses the
same core fitting function of 'ahgainfit'.
</p>

<p>
'ahgainfit' takes as input an event file with time and energy columns,
and requires that the events are time ordered. The task accumulates
spectra from events that are consecutive in time, with energy centered
on the calibration feature and compares each spectrum from the events
with a theoretical model of the calibration feature profile. The
calibration feature used by 'ahgainfit' is specified by the parameter
'linetocorrect' as a string, and the names and energies of the
features are specified in a calibration file (parameter
'linefitfile'). The calibration feature may be composed of many atomic
or nuclear line components that are listed in the calibration file.
</p>

<p>
The energy range for the spectra constructed from the event file as
well as from the theoretical profile, may be specified in two
different ways. (1) The default energy range for the spectra is the
smallest and largest energies of the line components, and expanded
with the 'extraspread' parameter, i.e.  [E_min - extraspread : E_max +
extraspread].  It is recommended to set 'extraspread' larger than the
sum of the natural width of the calibration feature, the value of the
'broadening' parameter, and the magnitude of the expected energy
shift.  (2) Alternatively, the energy range may be specified by
setting the 'startenergy' and 'stopenergy' parameters. If these
parameters are non-negative 'ahgainfit' uses their values to
accumulate the spectra, instead of the range derived using the
'extraspread' setting.  The energy column used to accumulate the
spectra is specified by the 'energycol' parameter. The energy column
is expected to be in units of channel, where the eV per channel is set
by the 'evchannel' parameter. The spectra are binned according to the
'binwidth' parameter, where the 'binwidth' is in units of 'energycol'
channels. The theoretical profile is constructed on a mesh defined by
this energy range and 'binwidth', where each calibration line is
assumed to be Lorentzian. The profile may be convolved with a
Gaussian having the FWHM given by the 'broadening' parameter.
</p>

<p>
The number of events in each spectrum is defined by the 'numevent' and
'minevent' parameters. The task accumulates spectra with a number of
events between 'minevent' and 'numevent'. However, if a spectrum has
fewer than 'minevent' points, then it is combined with the previous
spectrum if possible. Therefore all spectra have a size between
'minevent' and ('numevent+minevent-1'). To avoid having spectra
accumulated over large gaps in time, the group of points in the
spectrum is truncated when the time interval between consecutive
events is greater than the 'gapdt' parameter. Adjacent spectra in time
may share a percentage of their points based on the 'grpoverlap'
parameter that may vary between 0 and 100. If 'grpoverlap' is set to
0, the consecutive spectra share no points in common; if set to 100
they share all points in common but one.
</p>

<p>
The spectra events may be simultaneously collected based on the value
of a column present in the event file, given by the 'splitcol'
parameter.  This option may be used, for example, to find the gain
correction for each layer of the HXI detector ('splitcol=LAYER').  If
a GTI file is specified by the 'gtifile' parameter, events outside of
these GTI intervals are excluded. Spectra are not accumulated across
GTI intervals unless the 'spangti' parameter is set to 'yes'.
</p>

<p>
For each accumulated spectrum, 'ahgainfit' fits the theoretical
profile to the data and also derives binned and unbinned averages.  A
least-squares method is used in the fitting. The fitted parameters are
energy shift, scaling factor, background (unless the 'background'
parameter is set to NONE), and, optionally, convolution width if
'fitwidth=yes'. The background is fit with a constant value if
'background' is set to CONSTANT, and a power-law if set to SLOPE.  The
unbinned average energy (as specified by 'energycol') is the sum of
the energies in the spectrum divided by the number of events in the
spectrum.  The binned average energy is the weighted average derived
by summing, over bins in the spectrum, the product of the energy and
number of events per bin, and then dividing by the total number of
events in the spectrum.  The fitted gain correction is computed from
the fitted shift with respect to the theoretical line profile.  The
binned average gain correction is computed from the difference between
the profile and spectrum averages. 
</p>

<p>
The default values for the parameters used in the fitting method
('minwidth0', 'maxitcycle', 'r2tol', 'searchstepshift', 'maxdshift',
'bisectolshift', 'searchstepwidth', 'maxdwidth', 'bisectolwidth', and
'minwidth') should not need to change since already optimized.
</p>

<p>
The output file has two extensions. One extension, GRID_PROFILE,
contains the energies and amplitudes of the theoretical profile used
in the fitting procedure, including any convolution from the
'broadening' parameter.  The other extension, DRIFT_ENERGY, reports
the fitting results for each spectra in the following columns: TIME
(midpoint of the time interval over which the spectrum is collected),
splitcol (value of splitcol for spectrum as given by the 'splitcol'
parameter; this column is absent if 'splitcol=NONE'), COR_FIT (energy
correction factor from spectrum fit), COR_AVE (energy correction
factor from spectrum average), CHISQ (reduced chi-squared of the fit),
AVGUNBIN (average energy of events in spectrum prior to binning),
AVGBIN (weighted spectrum average energy), AVGFIT (average energy from
fit), SHIFT (fitted energy shift), SCALE (fitted vertical scaling
factor), BGRND (fitted background), WIDTH (if 'fitwidth=no', same as
broadening parameter; if 'fitwidth=yes', fitted width), TELAPSE
(difference between times of first and last event in spectrum),
EXPOSURE (calculated using the GTI), NEVENT (total number of events
collected for this spectrum), BINMESH (array containing the count
spectrum energy bins), SPECTRUM (array containing the observed binned
count spectrum), FITPROF (array containing theoretical profile with
fitted parameters applied). If the 'calcerr' parameter is set to
'yes', one-sigma errors for the SHIFT and WIDTH are calculated. The
errors are calculated with chi-squared and maximum-likelihood methods
and output in the columns SIGSHCHI2, SIGWDCHI2, SIGWDLIKE and
SIGWDLIKE respectively. If 'writeerrfunc' parameter is set, the
chi-squared and likelihood calculated valued are output in the arrays
SHCHI2, SHLIKE, WDCHI2 and WDLIKE. The numbers of values output in
these arrays are specified in the 'nerrshift' and 'nerrwidth'
parameters, respectively.
