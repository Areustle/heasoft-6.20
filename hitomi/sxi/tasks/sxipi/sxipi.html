<h2>NAME</h2>

sxipi -- Calculate pulse invariant (PI) values and assign grades for SXI events.


<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>sxipi infile outfile hkfile</tt>


<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
'sxipi' calculates a pulse invariant (PI), a value proportional to the
X-ray energy, for each event in an SXI event list by applying several pulse
height corrections and a grade assignment.  There are 5 major steps in this
task: 
</p>

<p>
1. Video board temperature (or even-odd column) correction <br>
2. Charge trail correction <br>
3. Charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) correction <br>
4. Grade assignment and PHA summation; <br>
5. PHA to PI conversion (gain correction) <br>
</p>

<p>
In Step 1, differences in PHAS between even and odd CCD columns are corrected.
Each CCD chip is associated with two circuit boards (ASICs) where the 
raw pixel output is amplified and digitized. To speed up the signal
processing, one of the ASICs reads signals transferred from the even-RAWX
pixels, while the other reads those from the odd-RAWX pixels.  The
conversion of analog to digital signal can differ for different ASICs, and
this conversion depends on the temperature of the video board at the
location of the ASIC.  This step removes those differences, correcting the
pixel pulse height values so they are on the same scale for a given event.
The video board temperature is read from the HK file specified by the
parameter 'hkfile', with other parameters 'hkext', 'hkcolstem', and
'hkvideoid' specifying where in the file that information is.  Step 1 can
be turned on and off with the 'evnoddcor' parameter.
</p>

<p>
In Steps 2 and 3, the task corrects the pulse height information of
individual pixels to account for charge lost during the transfer.  When the
detected events are transferred for readout, some amount of charge is
trapped by defects in the CCD chips, which are mainly caused by radiation
damage.  Some of the trapped charge is released immediately after a
one-pixel transfer, resulting in a 'trail' into the following pixel.
Long-timescale charge traps release the charge in pixels outside of the
event island, effectively losing this information.  Charge injection was
developed as a way to mitigate CTI by periodically filling traps with rows
of 'sacrificial' charge.  As a result, the CTI strongly depends on the
configuration of charge injection, and the task reads that configuration
information from the event file header keywords.  Step 2 can be turned on
and off with the 'chtrailcor' parameter, and Step 3 with the 'cticor'
parameter.
</p>

<p>
The CTI calibration for SXI depends on the event GRADE, however this
information is not calculated until Step 4.  If the parameter
'ctigrade=yes', the GRADE column of the input event list is used in the CTI
correction.  If 'ctigrade=no', the GRADE column is ignored.  Proper CTI
correction requires an initial run of sxipi with 'ctigrade=no' to populate
the GRADE column, and then a second run of sxipi with 'ctigrade=yes' on the
output file of the first run.  The parameter 'copygrade' can be used to
copy the original GRADE and PHA columns to GRADE_COPY and PHA_COPY columns
before they are overwritten, to compare results with and without
grade-dependent CTI correction.
</p>

<p>
In Step 4, a GRADE is assigned to each event based on the number and
position of surrounding pixels whose pulse height exceeds the split
threshold.  These pulse heights are recorded for individual 3x3 pixels in
the PHAS column, and the hit pattern of the outer 5x5 (16 pixel) ring is
also used by way of the P_OUTER_MOST column.  The total event pulse height
amplitude (PHA) is calculated by summing up the PHAS in the pattern.  Step
4 is always performed and cannot be turned off.
</p>

<p>
In the default usage, the split threshold is energy-dependent, optimized
depending on the tentative PHA value.  A split threshold is optimized for
each event in the following way: (1) a tentative GRADE is assigned using an
initial fixed split threshold; (2) a tentative summed PHA is calculated;
(3) the optimum split threshold is determined; and (4) the final GRADE
assignment and PHA value are determined.  There are 4 parameters related to
this optimization process, 'spthiter', 'spthcaldb', 'spthoffset', and
'spthslope'.  The default values of the first two parameters are both
'yes'.  In this case, the values in the last two parameters are ignored,
and the split threshold optimization proceeds normally.  In the case of
'spthcaldb=no', the values of 'spthoffset' and 'spthslope' are read and
used, instead of the CALDB values, for the optimization.  If 'spthiter=no',
the iteration described above is not performed, and a constant split
threshold from CALDB (if 'spthcaldb=yes') or 'spthoffset' (if 'spthcaldb =
no') is used for the grade assignment.  The 'spthslope' parameter is
ignored in both cases with 'spthiter=no'.
</p>

<p>
In Step 5, PHA is converted to PI using the gain correction table.  PI is
directly proportional to the X-ray energy, with 1 PI channel = 6 eV for
SXI.  Step 5 can be turned on and off with the 'gaincor' parameter.
If turned off, PHA is simply copied to PI.
</p>

<p>
Bad pixels in the surrounding 3x3 ring can alter the grade and final PI of
an event, possibly causing bad (e.g. particle) events to migrate to good
events, thus losing information about the true event pulse height.  The
'badpixopt' parameter, along with the PHAS_MASK column (see the sxiflagpix
help) can be used to mitigate this by specifying how events with bad pixels
should be graded and summed.  There are three options, which are listed in
the parameter description below.
</p>

<p>
For debugging and calibration purposes, the corrections in Steps 1-3 and 5
can be turned on or off independently using the 'evnoddcor', 'chtrailcor',
'cticor', and 'gaincor' parameters.  Event grades and summed PHA values are
always calculated.  Furthermore, the intermediate results from each
correction can be included in the output by specifying 'debugcol=yes'.  Any
of these debugging columns or the PHAS or PHA column can then be used as
the starting point for another run of sxipi with the 'startcol' parameter.
It is important to note that any corrections turned on with 'evnoddcor',
'chtrailcor', 'cticor', and 'gaincor' are performed regardless of the
'startcol', and so it is possible to perform the same correction twice.  If
'startcol=PHA', then all corrections that are enabled are applied to the
PHAS column, but the gain correction in Step 5 is applied to the PHA column
in the input file.  For processing of normal science data, these features
should not be used, and these parameters should be kept at their default
values of 'yes'.
</p>

<p>
This task sets the following STATUS flags if an event satisfies certain
conditions, shown in the table below.  See the 'sxiflagpix' help file for a
full list of STATUS flags.

</p>

<p>
<dt>(badpixopt = 2) [integer]</dt>
<dd>Option specifying how to process events that contain bad pixels.  Must
be an integer in the range 1-3.  If set to 1, bad pixels are not flagged in
the 3x3 and all PHAS values are used to grade and calculate the summed PHA.
This is the method used by the Suzaku XIS.  If set to 2, the task applies
PHAS_MASK to mask out bad pixels in the 3x3 and set them to NULL.  Grading
and PHA summation are then done normally, effectively ignoring these
pixels.  If set to 3, the task applies PHAS_MASK to mask out bad pixels in
the 3x3 and set them to NULL.  The GRADE, PHA, and PI values are also set
to NULL and these are considered bad events.  This is the most conservative
option, ensuring better fidelity at the expense of fewer counts.</dd>

</p>

<p>
<dt>(randomize = yes) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>If set to yes, randomization is used to convert the input integer PHAS
or PHA column to floating point ([yes]/no).  If 'startcol' is

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<ol>

<li>  Run sxipi with default parameters
<pre>
sxipi infile=ah_sxi_input.evt outfile=ah_sxi_output.evt hkfile=ah123456789sxi.hk
</pre>
</li>

<li> Run sxipi disabling the CTI correction
<pre>
sxipi infile=ah_sxi_input.evt outfile=ah_sxi_output.evt hkfile=ah123456789sxi.hk \
     cticor=no
</pre>
</li>

<li> Run sxipi using a constant split threshold of 20.
<pre>
sxipi infile=ah_sxi_input.evt outfile=ah_sxi_output.evt hkfile=ah123456789sxi.hk \
     spthiter=no spthcaldb=no spthoffset=20
</pre>
</li>

<li> Run sxipi with debugging columns output.
<pre>
sxipi infile=ah_sxi_input.evt outfile=ah_sxi_output.evt hkfile=ah123456789sxi.hk \
     debugcol=yes
</pre>

<li> Run sxipi on the previous output, starting with the charge trail
correction and only applying that.  This requires that the debugging
columns are present in the input file, so sxipi must have been run
previously.
<pre>
sxipi infile=ah_sxi_sxipi1_debug.evt outfile=ah_sxi_sxipi2_debug_onlychtrail.evt \
     hkfile=ah123456789sxi.hk startcol=PHAS_EVENODD evnoddcor=no chtrailcor=yes  \
     cticor=no debugcol=yes 
</pre>

<li> Run sxipi, skipping the even odd, charge trail, and CTI corrections.
This would be useful for verifying the gain (PHA to PI conversion)
calibration quality alone.  Debug columns are also output to verify the
proper corrections were made (or not).
<pre>
sxipi infile=ah_sxi_input.evt outfile=ah_sxi_output_onlygain.evt \
     hkfile=ah123456789sxi.hk evnoddcor=no chtrailcor=no cticor=no \
     debugcol=yes 
</pre>
