<h2>NAME</h2>

sxiflagpix -- Flag pixel STATUS for SXI event data


<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>sxiflagpix infile outfile outbadimg hotpixfile flickpixfile </tt> 


<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
'sxiflagpix' flags SXI events that may be unsuitable to use in data
analysis, such as those that fall on defective or non-sensitive pixels;
those that might have missing or compromised telemetry; and those for which
processing has encountered certain errors.   The STATUS column is updated,
encoding the flagging condition for each event.  This tool does not
actually filter or remove events, however the STATUS column can be used for
later filtering.  An image in DET coordinates showing the location of
unsuitable pixels is also output for later use in constructing an ARF or
flat field image.
</p>

<p>
The tool uses several input files to assign STATUS: a list of bad or dead
pixels or columns that don't change ("badpixfile"); a list of hot pixels,
which can change on short timescales and are observation-specific
("hotpixfile"); a list of flickering pixels, which can be produced by the
task searchflickpix ("flickpixfile"); and a mask file that encodes the
location of CCD boundaries, segments, calibration source regions, and other
regions that don't change ("maskfile").  The locations of the charge
injection rows are read from the input event list header, as are settings
for window mode and area discrimination.  
</p>

<p>
In addition to an output event list with updated STATUS column, sxiflagpix
optionally outputs a bad pixel list (specified by the parameter
'outbadpix') containing the events that have any STATUS flag set by the
tool.  Also output is an image (specified by the parameter 'outbadimg') in
SXI DET coordinates containing a value for each pixel corresponding to its
STATUS.  The values in these files are, in order of increasing precedence:
</p>

<p>
0: a good pixel  <br>
1: a pixel inside the calibration source region  <br>
2: a bad pixel set by the parameter "bad_status"  <br>
-1: a pixel out of the CCD, window, or area discrimination region
</p>

<p>
For example, a pixel inside the calibration region but flagged as bad 
has value 2 in the output image.  Flickering pixels are not included in
this map because they can depend on time.  Note that the output bad pixel
list contains only those pixels for which events are found in the input
file, while the output image contains all pixels.
</p>

<p>
Below is a table mapping flag bit position in the STATUS column to
particular flagging conditions.  If the flag is set to 1, that condition is
flagged.  Unless otherwise noted, the STATUS values apply to the central
pixel of an event.  Tools other than sxiflagpix that set STATUS values are
noted in parentheses.  "CI" indicates "charge injection."

<p>
The special STATUS flag 1 is set for any event that has a STATUS flag
listed in the "bad_status" parameter.  This is to enable easy filtering
syntax later in the processing, since good events can be extracted with a
simple filter expression.
</p>

<p>
Several STATUS conditions apply to events where neighboring pixels are
flagged.  Because an event is composed of a 3x3 pixel island, the quality
of the region immediately surrounding the event center must be taken into
account.  For example, a bad pixel in the outer ring of a 3x3 island does not 
produce a valid pulse height, and this could result in a event with an
otherwise unacceptable grade being accepted as a good event.  The
parameters 'npixnbr' and 'nboundnbr' can be used to set the maximum
distance away from a bad pixel or boundary to flag further pixels and
events.  In addition, for more flexibility, sxiflagpix writes a new column
PHAS_MASK to the output event list.  This is a 9-element mask of the PHAS
column, with each element indicating whether the corresponding pixel i in
PHAS is good (PHAS_MASK[i]=0) or bad (PHAS_MASK[i]=1).  PHAS_MASK can be
used later in sxipi to determine how to grade the event and calculate the
summed PHA, using the sxipi 'badpixopt' parameter.  Since sxipi can
overwrite the PHAS column, the ability to reset it to the original
telemetry values is provided here with the 'copyphas' parameter.
Similarly, 'resetflags' can be used to reset all the sxiflagpix STATUS
flags and the elements of PHAS_MASK to zero. Using 'resetflags=yes' does
not change the flags shown above that are set by sxipi or sxiphas.
</p>

<p>
Some pixels are affected by cosmic ray echo, in which a cosmic ray
detected during an SXI dark frame can cause an echo in a different
readout segment.  This echo then causes those pixels to have a pulse
height above the split threshold for the duration of the observation,
leading to incorrect grades for events centered in neighboring pixels.
Specifying 'echoflag=yes' causes 'sxiflagpix' to search for such
pixels in all SXI segments except the aimpoint segment (CCD_ID==1,
SEGMENT==1), which is free of this effect.  If at least 'echofrac' of
the events containing a given pixel have a pulse height greater than
or equal to 'echospth' in that pixel, then the pixel is considered a
cosmic ray echo pixel.  Any events centered 'echonbr' pixels from
such pixels have STATUS flag 37 set, and if flag 37 is specified in
'bad_status', any pixels within 'echonbr' of that pixel will be
marked as bad in the 'outbadimg'.  For SXI, 'echonbr=2' is the
recommended value, which will flag a 5x5 area of pixels around any
cosmic ray echo pixel.  Only pixels that have data from at least
'echomin' events are considered.  An image of the echo fraction can
be written out as an extension to 'outbadimg' if 'echomap=yes', and
used for diagnostic purposes.
</p>

<p>
Charge trailed or leaked from charge injection rows can produce spurious
events in several rows immediately surrounding the injected rows,
manifesting as noise at soft energies.  The parameters 'citrailnbr' and
'ciprenbr' can be used to tune a compromise between lower noise and higher
efficiency, since flagging additional rows reduces the effective area.  
</p>

<p>
Some examples of how to use the STATUS flags in filtering and extracting
events are shown below in the "Examples" section.  Also see the help for
'calc_express' for proper filtering syntax.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<ol>

<li> Run sxiflagpix with default parameters.
<pre>
sxiflagpix infile="input.evt" outfile="output.evt" outbadimg="outbadimg.fits" \
     hotpixfile="hotpix.fits" flickpixfile="flickpix.fits"
</pre>
</li>

<li> Run sxiflagpix without bad pixel file and flickering pixel file.
<pre>
sxiflagpix infile="input.evt" outfile="output.evt" outbadimg="outbadimg.fits" \
     hotpixfile="hotpix.fits" flickpixfile=NONE badpixfile=NONE
</pre>
</li>

<li> Run sxiflagpix with more restrictive flagging of rows neighboring the
     charge injection rows.
<pre>
sxiflagpix infile="input.evt" outfile="output.evt" outbadimg="outbadimg.fits" \
     hotpixfile="hotpix.fits" flickpixfile="flickpix.fits" \
     citrailnbr=4 ciprenbr=2
</pre>
</li>

<li> Run sxiflagpix with non-default bad_status setting.
<pre>
sxiflagpix infile="input.evt" outfile="output.evt" outbadimg="outbadimg.fits" \
     hotpixfile="hotpix.fits" flickpixfile="flickpix.fits" \
     bad_status="3:9,11:12,16"
</pre>
</li>

<li> (After running sxiflagpix) extract only those events from the output, 
which are "good", i.e. which have STATUS flag 1 set to 0.  Note the use of
a vector element, which in this case is STATUS[1] to get flag 1.  Also note
the bit mask "b0".
<pre>
ftcopy "output.evt[events][STATUS[1]==b0]" output_filtered.evt
</pre>
</li>

<li> (After running sxiflagpix) extract good events (STATUS flag 1 = 0)
only in the calibration source regions (STATUS flag 2 = 1). 
<pre>
ftcopy "output.evt[events][STATUS[1]==b0 && STATUS[2]==b1]" output_filtered.evt
</pre>
Another way to do the same filtering, using the "bxxx" bit mask notation,
which is explained fully under "calc_express".  The wild card "x" indicates
any value is allowed.
<pre>
ftcopy \
     "output.evt[events][STATUS==b01xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx]" \
     output_filtered.evt
</pre>
</li>

</ol>
