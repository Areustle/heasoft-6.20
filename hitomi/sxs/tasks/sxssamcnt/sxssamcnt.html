<h2>NAME</h2>

sxssamcnt - Calculate the local time in the SXS files necessary to assign time

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>sxssamcnt infile outfile</tt> 

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
'sxssamcnt' calculates the 'local time' and fills the column(s) SAMPLECNT(#) in the
SXS event, lost GTI  and HK files. Sample count represents the fine time resolution, assigned 
internally by the instrument electronics. After 'sxssamcnt' is run, the task 'ahtime' 
synchronizes the fine local time to the TT time (obtained via the GPS) written 
in the TIME column. 

'sxssamcnt' runs : on science antico and pixel event files; on the diagnostic 
mode wfrb and noiserec for antico and pixel data and pulserec for the pixel data;
on the gti lost for antico and pixel and on specific extensions of the HK data. 
The calculation of the samplecnt uses different columns depending on the 
input data type. 
a) For all type of events detected by the pixel array the columns are: 
TRIG_LP, rough event trigger time,  TIME_VERNIER, fine time correction, WFRB_WRITE_LP, 
reference for the TRIG_LP and WFRB_SAMPLE_CNT, reference for the sample cnt.
b) For the antico events the columns are :  TRIG_LP, WFRB_WRITE_LP, WFRB_SAMPLE_CNT, FLG_EVENT_LOST.
c) For the HK the columns are : LATCH_SAMPLE_CNT1, reference to the sample count  and LATCH_BASE_CNT1, finer clock value.
d) For the lost GTI the columns are : EL_#_LP, TRIG_LP for the start and stop, WFRB_WRITE_LP and WFRB_SAMPLE_CNT. 
These column names may be set in the parameters 'col1', 'col2', 'col3', 'col4' and 'col5' depending on the input 
data file. <br>
The sample count calculation is written in the column(s) set by the parameter 'outcol'. 
For antico and HK, 'sxssamcnt' always calculates single value per each row that is written in the 
output column SAMPLECNT. For lost GTI, 'sxssamcnt' calculates two values for each row that are  
written in the columns SAMPLECNT1 and SAMPLECNT2. These are used by 'ahtime' to calculate the START and STOP.

For the pixel data, the task also calculates two local times for each row. The first, SAMPLECNTTRIG, is derived 
similarly to the other local time and is to enable the calculation of the event trigger time by 'ahtime'.
The other, SAMPLECNT, is derived with a polynomial function of SAMPLECNTTRIG, whose coefficient are stored
in CALDB, and is to enable the calculation of the event arrival time.

GTI, where '#' indicates that both start and stop times are
processed.</dd>

col2=DEFAULT, this is set to TIME_VERNIER for pixel and pulserec
event files, to  LATCH_base_Cnt1 for SXS-specific HK extension. 
For the antico, noiserec and lost GTI files this column is ignored.

parameters  'timever1' and 'timever2'. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(col3 = DEFAULT) [string]</dt>
<dd> Column name for the reference rough local time.  If
col3=DEFAULT, this is set to WFRB_WRITE_LP for pixel, antico, pulserec,
noiserec and lost GTI files. For SXS-specific HK extension is 
ignored.</dd>

<p>
<dt>(col4 = DEFAULT) [string]</dt>
<dd>Column name for the reference sample count. If col4=DEFAULT,
this is set to WFRB_SAMPLE_CNT for pixel, antico, pulserec,
noiserec and lost GTI files. For SXS-specific HK extension is
ignored.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(col5 = DEFAULT) [string]</dt>
<dd> Column name that specifies whether an antico event is a 'lost
antico event'. If col5=DEFAULT, this is set to FLG_EVENT_LOST, 
and the SAMPLECNT column is set to its NULL value.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(timever1 = 1) [integer]</dt>
<dd> Time to be added to the local time calculation. For lost GTI files 
this value is added to the sample count corresponding to the start.
For antico events this value is added to the SAMPLECNT column 
Default values are -8 for antico lost GTI, 0 for antico events.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(timever2 = 2) [integer]</dt>
<dd> 
Time to be added to the local time calculation. For lost GTI files
this value is added to the sample count corresponding to the stop.
Default  value is  23 for antico lost GTI.</dd>

lost GTI files, by default the columns are SAMPLECNT1 and SAMPLECNT2
else add to '1' and '2' to the string in 'outcol'.
