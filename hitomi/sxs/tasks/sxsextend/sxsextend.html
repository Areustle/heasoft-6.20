<h2>NAME</h2>

sxsextend -- Calculate the extended PI for the SXS event files

<h2>USAGE</h2>

sxsextend inuffile outuffile outclfile driftfile gtigenfile gtitelfile gtimxsfile 

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The baseline PI column populated by the pipeline has a maximun number of channels
 of 32768. Each  channel is 0.5 eV and the maximun energy in the spectrum is about 
 16.4 keV. The SXS may have signal collected up to 32 keV. 'sxsextend' allows to 
 extend the range of channels and therefore the range of energy. The result is 
 stored in a column named PIE.
 <p>
 'sxsextend' is a script that starting 
 from the unfiltered event file run in sequence 'sxspha2pi', 'sxsperseus' 
 (only for early Perseus data) and re-screen the data.
 Several files are required as input to 'sxsextend': the ufiltered event file,
 several gti files and the drift correction file. All these files are present 
 in the archive.  
 To extend the energy the parameters 'eminin', minimum energy in eV, 'dein', 
 bin size in eV, and 'nchanin', number of channels, are set to default value 
 to produce a spectra up to 32 keV with a bin size of 1 eV.
 The output are the unfiltered event file where the column PIE is populated 
 and the cleaned event file obtained by screening the unfiltered data
 using the input GTI and event screening criteria stored in CALDB.
