<h2>NAME</h2>

sxsflagpix -- Flag SXS events for antico and MXS event coincidence,
temporal proximity, and crosstalk

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>sxsflagpix infile inantfile outfile antpsp inmxsGTI</tt> 

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
  'sxsflagpix' identifies SXS events for coincidence with antico
  detector events and mxs events, temporal proximity between two
  events in any pixel, and electrical and recoil crosstalk. The
  identifications are written in the STATUS column. 'sxsflagpix'
  excludes lost and baseline pixel events, and events with risetime
  exceeding 127 if 'ckrisetime=yes', when determining event-to-event
  coincidence for temporal proximity, electrical and recoil crosstalk.
  It also excludes events below a PI threshold, set in the parameter 
  'pxpithr', for any coincidence defined in the parameter 'usepxpithr'.

  Any combination of flagging may be enabled by setting the 'calcant'
  (antico), 'calcprox' (proximity), 'calcctrec' (recoil crosstalk),
  'calcctel' (electrical crosstalk), 'calctel2' (electrical crosstalk
  2), and 'calcmxs' (MXS) switch parameters.  If the parameter
  'dtflag=yes', the time intervals between crosstalking events, or
  between pixel events and their coincident antico events, are written
  out to additional columns (DTCEL for electrical crosstalk, DTCEL2
  for electrical crosstalk 2, DTCTREC for recoil crosstalk, and DTANT
  for antico coincidence) if the corresponding flagging is enabled. An
  antico event file is required for antico flagging (see parameter
  'inantfile'). A GTI containing the times when the MXS is on is used
  to determine the MXS flagging (see parameter 'inmxsgti'). There is
  an option to input an additional GTI file, unrelated to the MXS, to
  flag events within that GTI (see 'gtifile' parameter). This file may
  contain multiple GTI extensions, one applicable to all pixels and
  the remaining applicable to each individual pixel.
</p>

<p>
  The STATUS column has 16 bits, 14 of which are currently in use and
  two of which are spare. The first bit flags events that are out or invalid 
  (0) or in and valid (1) of the GTI file applicable to all pixels.
   The second bit flags the events that are out or invalid (0) or in 
  and valid (1) of the GTI file
  applicable to individual pixels. The third bit flags events that are
  coincident with antico events (1). The fourth bit flags events that
  are within a temporal proximity (defined by parameter 'proxdt') of
  another event in any pixel (1). The fifth and sixth bits flag events
  for recoil crosstalk. The seventh and eight, and thirteenth and
  fourteenth, bits flag electrical crosstalk. The ninth through twelfth
  bits flag coincidence with MXS events. 
 
</p>

Two formats are supported for the GTI file.  The first format contains
up to 37 extensions: 1 general GTI and 36 pixel-dependent GTI.  The DETNAM
keyword for the general GTI must be PIXEL and the DETNAM keyword values for
the pixel-dependent GTIs are PIXnn where nn is the pixel number, e.g. PIX04
for pixel 4.  In this format, all extensions must contain columns START and
STOP which define the GTI.  The second format may have up to two
extensions: 1 general GTI with START and STOP columns and 1 pixel-dependent
extension with columns START, STOP, and PIXEL.  In the second format the
DETNAM keyword is set to PIXEL for both extensions.  if the input GTI has 
a single GTI extension with no DETNAM keyword defined, it is treated as a
general GTI.  If the events need to be filtered using multiple general or
pixel-dependent GTI files, they must first be merged into a single GTI file
using the 'sxspixgti'.

 <p>
   Antico flagging: 'sxsflagpix' flags a pixel event as coincident
   with and an antico event if the following condition is satisfied:
   antdtpre < t(pixel)-t(antico)+antshift < antdtfol. The value of the
   parameters 'antdtpre' and 'antdtfol' are time intervals that define
   the window of coincidence, and the antico time is adjusted by the
   parameter 'antshift' to account for the differences in time
   assignment of a pixel event compared to an antico event. The antico
   event file contains redundant entries for events channeled through
   both sides of the PSP (A and B). 'sxsflagpix' uses only events from
   one side. This is specified as either A or B by the 'antpsp'
   parameter.  Only antico events with duration and PHA greater then
   the threshold values determined by the 'antdurthr' and 'antphathr'
   parameters are considered in antico flagging.
</p>

<p>
  Recoil crosstalk flagging: 'sxsflagpix' flags a pixel event if it is
  a recoil crosstalk event with a cal-pixel (pixel 12) MnK X-ray
  event. An event is considered as a recoil crosstalk event if its
  time is within the time interval 'ctrecdt' of a calpixel event and
  satisfies the following condition: ENERGY(EVENT) <= ENERGY(MnKa_low)
  or ENERGY(MnKa_high) < ENERGY(EVENT) < ENERGY(MnKb_high), where
  ENERGY(MnKa_low), ENERGY(MnKa_high), and ENERGY(MnKb_high) are set
  by the parameters 'kalow', 'kahigh', and 'kbeta'.
</p>

<p>
  Electrical crosstalk flagging: 'sxsflagpix' flags electrical
  crosstalk across groups of pixels that are in wiring proximity,
  using two different time intervals (one short, 'cteldt' parameter,
  and one long, 'cteldt2' parameter). For each time scale, the
  flagging uses two bits. STATUS bits 7-8 are assigned to the short
  timescale, and bits 13-14 to the long timescale as follows: 00 - no
  crosstalk, 10 - multiple pixels active within that timescale, 11 -
  multiple pixels active within that timescale and this is the event
  with the largest PHA in the multiple-pixel crosstalk group.  Two
  electrically crosstalking pixels must be in the same quadrant of the
  SXS detector, and must have pixel indices within the quadrant
  separated by no more than the number given by the 'ctelnear' (short
  timescale) or 'ctelnear2' (long timescale) parameters. These
  quadrant assignments and indices are stored in the CALDB pixel map
  (see 'pixdeffile' parameter). If one or both of the electrical
  crosstalk flagging options is enabled, the crosstalk multiplicity is
  recorded in the two-digit CTMULT (short timescale) and/or CTMULT2
  (long timescale) columns as follows. The first digit gives the
  number of events in the crosstalk group, and the second digit the
  PHA rank of the event in the group where 1 is assigned to the event
  with the highest PHA.
</p>

</p>
MXS flagging: 'sxsflagpix' flags pixel events that are coincident
with MXS events defined using the MXS GTI (see 'inmxsgti'
parameter). Bits 9-10 are reserved for events coincidence with MXS
direct mode, 11-12 are reserved for events coincidence with MXS
indirect mode. Specifically, events with time within the MXS GTI set
bits 10 and 12. Events within the interval set by the parameter 'mxsdt'
(the MXS afterglow) set bits 9 and 11.
