<h2>NAME</h2>

sxsrmf - Create an SXS RMF file for selected SXS pixels and grades with weighting factors

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>sxsrmf infile outfile</tt> 
<p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
'sxsrmf' calculates the RMF for each SXS pixel and resolution grade
(High, Mid, or Low), by using the line spread function (LSF)
parameters stored in two extensions of a CALDB file. Then the task 
combines these RMFs into one RMF file according to an input file with
weighting factors for combinations of pixel and grade. 
The weighting factor file is created by the
'sxsmkrmf' script, and consist of a fits file with three columns (PIXEL, GRADE,
WEIGHT), where WEIGHT is defined as the ratio of counts for the
specific PIXEL and GRADE combination of the rmf generation
to the total in all selected PIXELS.
<p>

'sxsrmf' may be run to create an RMF for any SXS pixel 
and grade combination. This is archived by setting 'infile=none'
and use the parameters 'pixel' and 'resol' to select the 
pixel and the grade, respectively.  
If the 'outrsp' parameter is 'yes' and an ARF file is given with 
the 'arffile' parameter, the task also calculates and outputs an RSP 
file with filename given by the 'outrspfile' parameter.
</p>

 <p> 
The LSF consists of (1) a Gaussian core with a pixel-dependent FWHM,
(2) a low-energy exponential tail due to energy loss at the surface of
the absorbers, (3) an extended low energy electron loss continuum, and
(4) discrete escape peaks from M-shell fluorescence of Hg or Te in the
absorber. The latter three components are assumed to be
pixel-independent. All these components are stored in CALDB file in the 
'linesigma' and  'linetau' tables .
Four types of RMF files may be created small, medium, large and x-large.
The small (s/S) accounts only for the Gaussian core calculated with a width, 
defined in the CALDB linesigma table (see 'rmfsigma' parameter).
The medium (m/M) includes also the exponential tail for the line defined 
in the caldb linetau table (see 'rmftau' parameter); the large (l/L)
includes the escape peaks. The x-large (x/X)  adds the continuum down to the
minimum energy given by the 'emincont' parameter.  
Note that the x-large requires a minimum of 2 GB of memory, so this option 
is not recommended for normal usage. 
</p>

 <p>
The output RMF contains a MATRIX extension containing the response
matrix; and an EBOUNDS extension listing the energy boundaries of each
PI channel.
</p>

<p>
The energy bin size(s) of the RMF may be set with the 'dein'
parameter, with 'eminin' and 'nchanin' determining the energy range
for those bins (see below for more detail).  The input energy grid may
have multiple values for the number of energies and grid spacing to
support a nonuniform grid; however, the single-grid default parameter
values of 'eminin=0', 'dein=0.5', and 'nchanin=32768' are recommended.
Furthermore, the 'EBOUNDS' energy grid must match the PI grid of the
spectrum file. If the parameter 'useingrd=yes', the output grid is set
equal to the input grid. This is the recommended binning. However, the
'EBOUNDS' energy grid can be independently specified by setting the
parameter values of 'deout', 'eminout', and 'nchanout'. If
'useingrd=yes', the output grid parameters ignored.

<dl>

<p>
<dt>infile [filename]</dt>

  settings of the pixel and resol parameters, respectively.
</dd>
</p>


<p>
<dt>outfile [filename]</dt>
<dd>Name of output RMF file. 
</dd>
</p>


<p>
<dt>(outrsp = no) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>If yes, an output RSP file is created by combining the rmf with
  the input arf file specified by the arffile parameter (yes/[no]).
</dd>
</p>


<p>
<dt>(arffile = NONE) [filename]</dt>
<dd>Name of input ARF file. This parameter is ignored if outrsp=no.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(rspfile) [filename]</dt>
<dd>Name of output response (RSP) file. This parameter is ignored if outrsp=no.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(pixel = 0) [integer]</dt>
<dd>SXS array pixel (0-35) for which the RMF is calculated.
For each run only one pixel maybe be input.
This parameter is ignored unless infile is set to NONE.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(resol = H) [string]</dt>
<dd>SXS event resolution grade -- (H)igh, (M)id, or (L)ow -- for which
  the RMF is calculated. For each run only one grade maybe be input. 
This parameter is ignored unless infile is set to NONE.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(time = 2014-01-01T00:00:00) [string]</dt>
<dd>Start time for validity of RMF file in YYYY-MM-DD format. The task
selects the CALDB file corresponding to this time.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(whichrmf = L) [string]</dt>
<dd>Type of RMF to construct -- S(mall), M(edium), L(arge), or
X(tra-large).  The 'X' option requires a minimum of 2 GB of memory,
and is not recommended for general use.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(rmfsigma = CALDB) [filename]</dt>
<dd>Input file containing the parameters for the Gaussian core. If set
to CALDB, the file is read from the calibration database. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(rmftau = CALDB) [filename]</dt>
<dd>Input file containing the parameters for the exponential tail,
electron continuum, and escape peaks.  If set to CALDB, the file is
read from the calibration database.</dd>
</p>

<p>
  <dt>(eminin = 0.0) [real]</dt>
  <dd>Minimum energy of the MATRIX grid in eV.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(dein = 0.5) [string]</dt>
<dd>Spacing of energy bins (in eV) in each interval of the MATRIX
grid. A single value (e.g., 0.5 as the default) applies a constant
grid spacing for the entire matrix. Multiple values separated by
commas (e.g., '0.5,2.0') create a variable grid spacing starting at
eminin.  The number of channels in each energy interval must be
specified with nchanin. The values may be floating point.</dd>
</p>

<p>
  <dt>(nchanin = 32768) [string]</dt>
  <dd>Number of channels in each interval of the MATRIX grid. Combined
    with the default values of the previous two parameters, the
    default means that the output MATRIX has 32768 channels with 0.5
    eV size up to 16384 eV. If, instead, dein='0.5,2.0' and
    nchanin='26000,6500' the output MATRIX would have 26000 bins (with
    0.5 eV size) up to 13000 eV, and 6500 bins (with 2 eV size) above
    13000 eV (hence up to 26000 eV).  dein and nchanin must have the
    same number of intervals.  The values of nchanin must be
    integers.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(useingrd = yes) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>If useingrd is set to yes the output grid is set equal to the input
grid, and the output grid parameters are ignored. In this case nchanin
and dein may only have single values. If useingrd is set to no the output grid
is determined by eminout, deout, and nchanout ([yes]/no).</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(eminout = 0.0) [real]</dt>
<dd>Minimum energy of EBOUNDS in eV. The default value is 0.0. This parameter is
ignored if useingrd is set to yes.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(deout = 0.5) [real]</dt>
<dd>Spacing of the EBOUNDS energy grid in eV. This must be consistent
  with the assumed energy grid of the PI file (i.e., 0.5 eV for the
  SXS).  This parameter is ignored if useingrid is set to yes.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(nchanout = 32768) [integer]</dt>
<dd>Number of channels in EBOUNDS. This must be consistent with the
number of PI channels in the PHA file.  The default value for SXS is
32768. This parameter is ignored if useingrd is set to yes.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(rmfthresh = 1.0e-9) [real]</dt>
<dd>Low threshold for the RMF construction. For a given X-ray photon
energy, the normalized probability (i.e., a value less than 1) of
producing a certain PI value is calculated for each channel and
written in the MATRIX extension.  If the probability is less than this
threshold, 0 (zero) is written for that element.  Using the default
value (1.0e-9) is secure enough for most cases.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(emincont = 10.0) [real]</dt>
<dd>Lower energy limit [eV] of electron continuum.</dd>
</p>


<p>
<dt>(buffer = -1) [integer] </dt>
<dd> Rows to buffer (-1=auto, 0=none, >0=numrows). </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(clobber = no) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Overwrites the existing output file if set to yes (yes/[no]). </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer] </dt>
<dd>Chatter level for output. Set to 0 to suppress output, 
or to 1, 2, or 3 for increasing the chatter of the output. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(logfile = !DEFAULT) [string]</dt>
<dd>Log filename. If set to DEFAULT uses the name of the task and, if
preceded by '!', overwrite the file if it exists. If set to NONE no
log file is created. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(debug = no) [boolean]</dt>

(yes/[no]).</dd>
</p>

<p>
