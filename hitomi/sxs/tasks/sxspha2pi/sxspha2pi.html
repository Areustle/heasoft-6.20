<h2>NAME</h2>

sxspha2pi -- Calculate the PI for the SXS event files

<h2>USAGE</h2>

sxspha2pi infile outfile

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>'sxspha2pi' calculates and populates the PI column in the SXS event file.
 'sxspha2pi' first derived an energy column, EPI and EPI2 (energy in eV),
 and after calculates the PI column(channel).
 By default the gain correction uses the PHA column that contains the
 telemetered values and the computed energy value is written in the EPI column.
 If the secondary events were corrected using the task 'sxsseccor', a new column 
 containing a combination of the telemetered PHA values for primary events and 
 corrected PHA values for the secondary events is present in the file. 
 The name of the column is PHA2, if 'sxsseccor' is run with the default values.
 To use this column for the gain correction, users may specify the column name 
 using the parameter 'secphacol'. The ouput of the gain calculation using the 
 'secphacol' is written in EPI2. NOTE: if the 'secphacol' is set to PHA, 
 the EPI and EPI2 contains the same values.  
 'sxspha2pi' always calculates the PI value using the EPI2 column. 

 <br>
 The EPI (or EPI2)  is obtained by using the 'driftfile' derived with the
 'sxsgain' task and the gain CALDB file.
  The gain CALDB file contains gain curves at  three temperatures
  The 'driftfile' provides the relation of PHA versus temperature
  so that the calibration line is at the correct energy. The relation
 is computed with two methods average and fit and either result may be used 
 in 'sxspha2pi' (see parameter 'method').  

  If the drift file is constructed using the calibration pixel (pixel 12), 
  there is only one correction, for each method, that is applied to 
  all pixels. A CALDB scale file may adjust the gain per pixel if specified 
  in the parameter 'scalefile' and if 'scaleepi' is set to yes.
  If the drift file is constructed using the MXS sources or the Fe55 
  filter the corrections are for each individual pixel in the array. 
 <br> 

  'sxspha2pi' reads the 'driftfile' and for each event searches the appropriate 
  correction in time, within  a time interval defined by the parameter 'gapdt' 
  and pixel if  the driftfile is from the MXS of the FE55 filter.
  After read the energy, 'sxspha2pi' constructs using the gain table from CALDB curves of 
  temperature versus energy using the event PHA value. Then 
  'sxspha2pi' reads the 'driftfile' and searches for the
  temperature, within  a time interval defined by the parameter 'gapdt'
  around the time of the event and  pixel if the driftfile is from
  the MXS of the FE55 filter. The temperature vs Energy table is interpolated
  to get the EPI corresponding to the temperature from the driftfile.

  The EPI (or EPI2) column is set to null if there is not corresponding entry
  in the drift file within the time interval of the event and pixel..
  'sxspha2pi' treats all the events as primary when calculating the EPI.

  The PI value is calculated as PI=floor((EPI2-0.5)/0.5 + 1.0 )
  For SXS good events, the PI ranges between 0 and 32767 in channel 
  where each channel is 0.5 eV. The PI is set to null if the EPI2 
  is null or the PI < 0.  If the PI > 32767,  PI is set to 32767.
  For SXS baseline event the PI ranges -16384 and 16383.
  If a baseline  event is outside this range the PI is set to null.

 <br>
  The UPI column is calculated if 'calcupi' parameter is set to yes. This 
  column is in energy (eV) derived using the gain file for a single temperature
  not corrected for the drift. The temperature is defined in the parameter
  'tempidx' and by default is set to the value written in the 
  TEMPIDX keyword of the 'driftfile'.
  For diagnostic purpose the PI calculation may be switched off 
  by setting the 'calcpi' parameter to no, and only the UPI column 
  is populated.
