<h2>NAME</h2>

sxsgain -- Calculate the time-dependent energy correction for SXS
events from comparison with known calibration lines


<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>sxsgain infile outfile</tt> 

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
  'sxsgain' calculates time-dependent SXS energy gain corrections by
comparing the theoretical and observed energies of a calibration line
or line complex. For each run of the task, only one line may be
specified to calculate the gain correction (see parameter
'linetocorrect'). The source of calibration X-rays may be specified as
either the SXS calibration pixel ('calmethod=Cal-pix'), the Modulated
X-ray Source ('calmethod=MXS'), or the Filter Wheel Fe55 source
('calmethod=Fe55'). In the first case only the calibration pixel
(pixel 12) correction is computed, otherwise distinct corrections are
computed for each pixel. The output may subsequently be utilized by
the 'sxspha2pi' task to assign photon energy and PI values. This task
requires that the TIME, PHA, and STATUS columns in the input file are
populated.
</p>

<p>
   'sxsgain' accumulates spectra from events that are consecutive in
time, with energy centered on the calibration feature and compares
each spectrum from the events with a theoretical model of the
calibration feature profile. The calibration feature used by 'sxsgain'
is specified by the parameter 'linetocorrect' as a string, and the
names and energies of the features are specified in a calibration file
(parameter 'linefitfile'). The calibration feature may be composed of
many atomic or nuclear line components that are listed in the
calibration file. Each calibration line is assumed to be Lorentzian.
  </p>

<p>
The energy range for the spectra constructed from the event file as
well as from the theoretical profile, may be specified in two
different ways. (1) The default energy range for the spectra is the
smallest and largest energies of the line components, and expanded
with the 'extraspread' parameter, i.e.  [E_min - extraspread : E_max +
extraspread].  It is recommended to set 'extraspread' larger than the
sum of the natural width of the calibration feature, the value of the
'broadening' parameter, and the magnitude of the expected energy
shift.  (2) Alternatively, the energy range may be specified by
setting the 'startenergy' and 'stopenergy' parameters. If these
parameters are non-negative 'sxsgain' uses their values to
accumulate the spectra, instead of the range derived using the
'extraspread' setting. The profile may be convolved with a
Gaussian having the FWHM given by the 'broadening' parameter.
</p>

<p>
  'sxsgain' proceeds in two steps for each spectrum. In the first
  step, the PHA shift of the spectrum with respect to the theoretical
  profile is derived, using both fitting and averaging methods. In the
  second step, these shifts are used to compute pixel temperatures
  that may subsequently be used by 'sxspha2pi' to assign PI.
</p>

<p>
  Step 1: In order to fit PHA spectra, the spectrum energy grid is
  converted to a PHA mesh by applying a reverse lookup using the
  appropriate set of gain coefficients. Gain coefficients are
  contained in the gain CALDB file (see parameter 'gainfile') for each
  pixel, resolution grade -- (H)igh, (M)id, and L(ow), and pixel
  temperature. For a given spectrum in a pixel, the gain corresponding
  to that pixel, grade given by the 'gaincoeff' parameter, and
  temperature given by the 'tempidx' parameter are used to define this
  mesh and to evaluate the theoretical profile on the PHA mesh.
<p>
The task proceeds by first constructing spectra within the prescribed
PHA range for groups of events consecutive in time and in the same
pixel. Only high-resolution primary events, or alternatively high- and
mid-resolution primaries (if 'usemp=yes'), are considered. Events may
be excluded from the fitting by independently checking the STATUS
column for antico, electrical crosstalk, and recoil crosstalk flags
if, respectively, 'ckant', 'ckctel', or 'ckctrec' parameters are set
to yes. If 'ckrisetime=yes', events with risetime>127 are likewise
excluded.  If a GTI file (see below GTI format)  is specified by the 'gtifile' parameter,
events outside of the GTI intervals are excluded as well. If
'calmethod' is set to MXS this GTI should only include times when the
MXS mode corresponding to 'linetocorrect' (direct mode for
'linetocorrect=CuKa, CuKb, CrKa, or CrKb'; indirect mode for
'linetocorrect=AlKa, AlKb, MgKa, or MgKb') are producing MXS
events. Spectra are not accumulated across GTI intervals unless
'spangti=yes'.
</p>

<p>
  The number of events in each spectrum is defined by the 'numevent' and
'minevent' parameters. The task accumulates spectra with a number of
events between 'minevent' and 'numevent'. However, if a spectrum has
fewer than 'minevent' points, then it is combined with the previous
spectrum if possible. Therefore all spectra have a size between
'minevent' and ('numevent+minevent-1'). To avoid having spectra
accumulated over large gaps in time, the group of points in the
spectrum is truncated when the time interval between consecutive
events is greater than the 'gapdt' parameter. Adjacent spectra in time
may share a percentage of their points based on the 'grpoverlap'
parameter that may vary between 0 and 100. If 'grpoverlap' is set to
0, the consecutive spectra share no points in common; if set to 100
they share all points in common but one.
</p>

<p>
For each accumulated spectrum, 'sxsgain' fits the theoretical profile
to the data and also derives binned and unbinned averages. A
least-squares method is used in the fitting. The fitted parameters are
energy shift, scaling factor, background (unless the 'background'
parameter is set to NONE), and convolution width if
'fitwidth=yes'. The background is fit with a constant value if
'background' is set to CONSTANT, and a power-law if set to SLOPE.  The
unbinned average PHA is the sum of the PHA in the spectrum divided by
the number of events in the spectrum.  The binned average PHA is the
weighted average derived by summing, over bins in the spectrum, the
product of the PHA and number of events per bin, and then dividing by
the total number of events in the spectrum.  The fitted gain
correction is computed from the fitted shift with respect to the
theoretical line profile.  The binned average gain correction is
computed from the difference between the profile and spectrum
averages.
<p>
Step 2: Once the fitting is completed for a spectrum in a pixel, the
fitted and average pixel temperatures are determined, and written to
the output gain file. The gain coefficients contained in the gain
CALDB file (parameter 'gainfile') for this pixel and the grade given
by the 'gaincoeff' parameter, are used to build a temperature
vs. energy table for the average PHA derived from the binned average
or from the fitting. The corresponding pixel temperatures at the
average energy of the input calibration feature are then obtained
using an n-point interpolation method, where n is the number of
temperatures in the gainfile to be used (see 'ntemp' parameter).
</p>

<p>
The default values for the parameters used in the fitting method
('minwidth0', 'maxitcycle', 'r2tol', 'searchstepshift', 'maxdshift',
'bisectolshift', 'searchstepwidth', 'maxdwidth', 'bisectolwidth', and
'minwidth') should not need to change since already optimized.
</p>

<p>
The output file has two extensions. One extension, GRID_PROFILE,
contains the energies and amplitudes of the theoretical profile used
in the fitting procedure, including any convolution from the
'broadening' parameter.  The other extension, DRIFT_ENERGY, reports
the fitting results for each spectra in the following columns: TIME
(midpoint of the time interval over which the spectrum is collected),
PIXEL, COR_FIT (energy correction factor from spectrum fit), COR_AVE
(energy correction factor from spectrum average), CHISQ (reduced
chi-squared of the fit), AVGUNBIN (average energy of events in
spectrum prior to binning), AVGBIN (weighted spectrum average energy),
AVGFIT (average energy from fit), SHIFT (fitted energy shift), SCALE
(fitted vertical scaling factor), BGRND (fitted background), WIDTH (if
'fitwidth=no', same as broadening parameter; if 'fitwidth=yes', fitted
width), TELAPSE (difference between times of first and last event in
spectrum), EXPOSURE (calculated using the GTI), NEVENT (total number
of events collected for this spectrum), BINMESH (array containing the
count spectrum energy bins), SPECTRUM (array containing the observed
binned count spectrum), FITPROF (array containing theoretical profile
with fitted parameters applied), TEMP_FIT (temperature derived from
fitted PHA; AVGFIT column), TEMP_AVE (temperature derived from average
PHA; AVGBIN column). If the 'calcerr' parameter is set to 'yes',
one-sigma errors for the SHIFT and WIDTH are calculated. The errors
are calculated with chi-squared and maximum-likelihood methods and
output in the columns SIGSHCHI2, SIGWDCHI2, SIGWDLIKE and SIGWDLIKE
respectively. If 'writeerrfunc' parameter is set, the chi-squared and
likelihood calculated valued are output in the arrays SHCHI2, SHLIKE,
WDCHI2 and WDLIKE. The numbers of values output in these arrays are
specified in the 'nerrshift' and 'nerrwidth' parameters, respectively.
</p>

<p>
Two formats are supported for the GTI file.  The first format contains
up to 37 extensions: 1 general GTI and 36 pixel-dependent GTI.  The DETNAM
keyword for the general GTI must be PIXEL and the DETNAM keyword values for
the pixel-dependent GTIs are PIXnn where nn is the pixel number, e.g. PIX04
for pixel 4.  In this format, all extensions must contain columns START and
STOP which define the GTI.  The second format may have up to two
extensions: 1 general GTI with START and STOP columns and 1 pixel-dependent
extension with columns START, STOP, and PIXEL.  In the second format the
DETNAM keyword is set to PIXEL for both extensions.  if the input GTI has 
a single GTI extension with no DETNAM keyword defined, it is treated as a
general GTI.  If the events need to be filtered using multiple general or
pixel-dependent GTI files, they must first be merged into a single GTI file
using the 'sxspixgti'.
