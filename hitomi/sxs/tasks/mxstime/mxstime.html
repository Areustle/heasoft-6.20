<h2>NAME</h2>

mxstime -- Calculate the times of the MXS start and stop and generates coarse and fine GTI files


<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>mxstime infile outfile outgti timfile delayfile</tt> 

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>

The Modulated X-ray Source (MXS) consists of two redundant pairs of LEDs,
one direct and one indirect fluorescent source that illuminate, with a
specific pulse length and spacing duty, the entire SXS array. 
The MXS may operate either one or both sources from one pair operating 
at a time. The telemetry information of the MXS is contained in the 
extension HK_SXS_FWE of the SXS housekeeping file.<br> 
'mxstime' by default always calculates the MXS start and stop times
and generates coarse and fine GTI files. The parameters 'calctime' and 'calcgti' 
may be used to only calculate the start and stop times or only the gti file.
'mxstime' calculates the start and stop times of the four LEDs that
are stored in the columns TIME_LED#_ON, TIME_LED#_OFF, where # has values 
1 to 4, of the HK_SXS_FWE extension. These times are calculated using: a)
the information in the columns TI_LED#_ON, TI_LED#_OFF, b) the header 
keywords TSTART and TSTOP, c) the column S_TIME, d) the TIM file associated 
to the observation, e) the caldb files containing the delay and the leapseconds.
Note within a file the TI_LED#_ON/OFF have the same value unless the 
LED# is turned on or off. <br>

'mxstime' also creates two gti files each containing four extensions, one for each LED. 
One GTI file records the coarse gtis corresponding to LED start and stop intervals. 
The coarse GTI output contains the START and STOP columns but also the
PLSLEN and PLSSPC columns, recording the pulse length and spacing. Each extension of the 
coarse GTI also includes two keywords LED#LEN LED#SPC, recording length and spacing.
These are set to positive numbers if there is only one pulse length and spacing for 
all coarse intervals, to negative otherwise and to 0 if that LED has not be turned on. <br>  
The second GTI file records the fine gti time corresponding to the individual pulses. 
The fine gtis are calculated using the telemetered information in the columns 
FWE_LED#_PLS_LEN FWE_LED#_PLS_SPC recording the pulse length and spacing.
'mxstime' by default always add a time to the stop time of each individual pulse
(see the parameter 'dtdecay'). By setting the parameter 'afterglow=no' no time is added 
to the stop time of each pulse. If the 'dtdecay' is large enough to overlap with the next pulse, 
the gti are merged to avoid creating double exposure. In this case the fine GTI is effectively
as the coarse GTI, except for the last stop time that is increased by 'dtdecay' (if the afterglow
parameter is set to 'yes'..<br>

For a given LED it is possible that the file only contains TI_LED#_ON or the TI_LED#_OFF value 
changes, but not both.
In this case the GTIs are calculated starting from the TI_LED#_ON, going forward to the
end of the file, or from the TI_LED#_OFF, going backward to the start of file, using the 
length and spacing appropriate for that LED. <br>
To all MXS times an offset is added that is specified in the parameter 'mxsoffset'.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
