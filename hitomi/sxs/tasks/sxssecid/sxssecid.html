<h2>NAME</h2>

sxssecid -- Associate SXS secondary events to the primary and allow to recalculate event grades


<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>sxssecid infile outfile</tt> 

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
  'sxssecid' executes in two calculations using the SXS event file :
   a) recalculate the grade for each event; 
   b) associate secondary events to the primary. The setting of the parameter 'regrade' 
   determines the order in which sxssecid executes the two functions. If 'regrade' 
   is set to 'yes', 'sxssecid' first recalculates the grades and after associates secondary 
   to the primary using the new recalculated grades. 
   If 'regrade' set to 'no', the grade are not recalculated and 'sxssecid' only associates
   secondary to the primary using the column specified in the parameter 'itypecol' (d/f ITYPE).
   In both calculations events are excluded if : 1) they are  flagged as baseline (BL) or event lost 
   (EL) in the on-board graded column ITYPE and/or 2) any of the parameters 'ckrisetime' (event 
   with risetime >127), 'ckctrec', 'ckctel', 'ckant' (event flagged in the STATUS column)
   are set to yes. By default all events below a PI threshold (see parameter 
   'pxpithr') are set to orphans when associate the secondary to the primary and skipped when 
   assign new grade if regrade = yes.</p>
  
<p>
 Regrading Calculation <br>  There are two components in the grade definition :
 1) if an event is primary or secondary and  2) if an event is
 High Mid or Low resolution. 'sxssecid' regrades the events per pixel
 by first identifying if an event is primary or secondary,
 using the parameter 'dtprimary', and after if it is High or Mid
 or Low resolution with the parameters 'dtmidhigh' and 'dtlowmid'.
 These parameters are used as follows. A primary event is
 defined as having no preceding event within 'dtprimary' and a
 secondary event has at least one preceding event within 'dtprimary'.
 An High-res event has no events within 'dtmidhigh' on either side,
 and Mid-res none within 'dtlowmid' on either side. <br>
 Combining the two definitions : a)  Hp events have no preceding event within
'dtprimary' and none within 'dtmidhigh'. b) Mp events have no preceding
 events within 'dtprimary' and must have the following event within
 'dtmidhigh' and 'dtlowmid'. Lp events have no preceding events
 within 'dtprimary' and must have the following event within
 'dtlowmid'. Ms events have at least one preceding event within
 'dtprimary' and no event within 'dtlowmid'. Ls events have at
 least one preceding event within 'dtprimary' and one event
 within 'dtlowmid'. <br>

 The new grades are written to a new column specified by the
  'itypecol' parameter using  the same on-board convention
 which is :  0 for Hp, 1 for Mp, 2 for Ms, 3 for Lp, 4 for Ls,
 5 for Baseline-BL, 6 for Lost - EL, 7 for Rejected - Rj.
 The name of the column may not be set to 'ITYPE' since a
 column named ITYPE already exist in the event file with
 the grades determined on on-board.

<p>

  Identification of the secondary <br>
  The on-board processing assigns grades to each event however does not 
  link the secondary to its parent primary. 'sxssecid' associates 
  secondaries to its parent event that occurs within the same pixel. 
  The primary-secondary association uses the grade definition as well as 
  a timing test. The grade information  is defined in a column of the event file
  (see parameter 'itypecol').  The timing test attempts to locate primary-secondary 
  within the same pixel that are within a time interval specified in the
  parameter 'dtmidhigh'. It assumes that there is only one primary either an 
  Hp and/or Mp and/or Lp for each pixel and all the secondaries are associated
  to these primary before next primary occurs.<br> 

   The output of the  primary-secondary association 
  uses three columns: INDEX provides a unique index for each event,
  GROUPS links the secondary to the primary, SEQ records the sequence of the associated
  events in a group.  The GROUPS column is populated as follows:
  Hp Mp and Ls events have GROUPS=INDEX; secondaries have GROUPS set equal
  to the index of the parent primary ; secondary events that do not have a primary 
  within 'dtmidhigh' (orphans) have GROUPS set to a negative value with 
  magnitude equal to the INDEX of the previous primary in the same pixel;
  events classified as baseline (BL) or lost (EL) have GROUPS set to NULL;
  GROUPS is set to NULL also for events that satisfy the condition set by the 
  parameters 'ckrisetime' (event with risetime >127), 'ckctrec', 'ckctel', 
  'ckant' (event flagged in the STATUS column) if they are set to yes.
  
  The sequence in the SEQ column is assigned using the ITYPE+1 on the events 
  in that sequence. For example the sequence Mp Ms Ms is recorded as 233 where each 
  digit is ITYPE+1. All events that belong to the same sequence have the same value 
  in the SEQ column.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>
1.  Find the associated primaries for secondaries in the file
event_in.fits based on their original grades and the definition of
secondaries given by the value of dtmidhigh in CALDB. Create
event_out.fits with INDEX, GROUPS and SEQcolumns populated accordingly.

<p>
<pre>
      sxssecid infile=event_in.fits outfile=event_out.fits
</pre>
<p>

2.  Find the associated primaries for secondaries in the file
event_in.fits based on a regrading with secondaries defined as those
with preceding events within 60 ms, and high/mid/low resolution
defined, respectively, as events with no events within 80 ms, at least
one event within 80 (but not within 20) ms, and at least one event
within 20 ms. Write the new grades to a new ITYPE2 column, and use this for
identifying secondaries.

<p>
<pre>
      sxssecid infile=event_in.fits outfile=event_out.fits dtprimary = 60 regrade=yes dtlowmid=20 dtmidhigh=80 itypecol=ITYPE2
</pre>
