<h2>NAME</h2>

sxsbranch -- Compute rates, branching ratios, and effective exposure
times for each SXS event grade for an input real or simulated file, or
based on a count rate

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>sxsbranch infile filetype outfile pixfrac pixmask countrate exposure</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
  'sxsbranch' computes rates, branching ratios, and effective exposure
  times for each SXS event grade based on the inputs (file or count
  rate). These are calculated for each pixel and for the entire
  array. 'sxsbranch' also statistically estimates the same quantities
  using the total rates from the input (file or rate) for the entire
  array using Poisson statistics. 'sxsbranch' operates in three modes:
  (1) no input file, (2) input simulated file, and (3) input file from
  observations.
</p>

<p>
(1) If there is no input file ('infile=NONE'), 'sxsbranch' internally
simulates events using the 'exposure' and 'countrate' parameters, with
counts distributed in the array according to the file specified by the
'pixfrac' parameter. If 'pixfrac=NONE' a uniform illumination is
assumed. Times are randomly assigned, and event grades assigned
accordingly. The branching ratio is calculated using these simulated
events. There are two different supported timing distributions within
the exposure: constant count rate profile ('flagburst=no') and
burst-like profile ('flagburst=yes'). To simulate a burst-like
lightcurve within the exposure, the following parameters also must be
set: 'ratburst' is the ratio of burst-peak/quiescent count rate; 'tburst'
gives the burst start time in sec after the beginning of the exposure;
'trise' is the rise time (assumed linear) in sec; and 'tdecay' is the
decay time (assumed exponential) in sec. The grades are assigned by
comparing the resulting time intervals between events with the time
interval values in the parameters 'dtmidhigh', 'dtlowmid', and 'dtprimary':
(a) high-resolution events have no preceding or following events
within 'dtmidhigh'; (b) mid-resolution events have at least one
preceding or following event within 'dtmidhigh', but none within
'dtlowmid'; (c) low-resolution events at least one preceding or
following event within 'dtlowmid'. (d) Primary events are defined as
having no preceding event within 'dtprimary'; (e) secondary events at
least one preceding event within 'dtprimary'. The outer 20 pixels may be
excluded from the branching ratio calculations by setting the
parameter 'pixmask=pixmask.txt'.
</p>
<p>
  (2) If the input file is an SXS event file from 'heasim' (infile set
  to the filename of the SXS event output file simulated with 'heasim'
  and 'filetype=sim'), 'sxsbranch' calculates the branching ratio
  using the simulated SXS file. The simulated files do not have grades
  assigned by 'heasim'. 'sxsbranch' first considers if events are
  crosstalking (the option if the parameters 'ctphafrac1' and/or
  'ctphafrac2' are different from zero), and subsequently assigns the
  grade using the event time and the calculated time intervals to the
  preceding and following events in the same pixel. The parameters
  used to calculate crosstalk are 'debin', 'enrgthr', 'ctphafrac1',
  and 'ctphafrac2'. These parameters are applied to all pixels. There
  are two crosstalk types: (a) the first occurs when an event induces
  crosstalk in the nearest electrical bonded pixel, (b) the second
  occurs when an event induces crosstalk in the next-nearest
  electrical bonded pixel. The first is calculated if 'ctphafrac1' is
  different from 0 and the event has ctphafrac1*PI >
  (enrgthr/debin). The second is calculated if 'ctphafrac2 'is
  different from 0 and the event has ctphafrac2*PI > (enrgthr /debin).
  The parameters 'ctphafrac1' and 'ctphafrac2' define the fraction of
  crosstalk energy to the original event energy, 'enrgthr' is the
  energy threshold above which crosstalk triggers, and 'debin' is the
  value of the PI bin in eV. The maximum possible crosstalk is induced
  for the default 'enrgthr=0'. The electrical proximity of the pixels is
  defined by the calibration map pixmap.fits (set by the parameter
  'ctelpixfile'). Grades are calculated using the 'dtmidhigh', 'dtlowmid',
  and 'dtprimary' parameters as described above.  The outer 20 pixels
  may be excluded from the branching ratio calculations by setting the
  parameter 'pixmask=pixmask.txt'.
</p>
<p>
  3) If the input SXS event file is from an observation (infile set to
  the SXS event filename from an observation and 'filetype=real'),
  'sxsbranch' calculates the branching ratio using this SXS observation
  event file. This option may be used after launch since the branching
  ratio calculation uses the on-board assigned grades. Events are
  excluded from the branching ratio calculation (a) if RISETIME is
  greater than the parameter rtmax, (b) if DERIV_MAX is less than the
  parameter dmmin, (c) if the event has the flag in the column
  SLOPE_DIFFER set, or (d) if the event is either a lost event or a
  baseline event. In addition, events are excluded from the branching
  ratio calculation if (e) the event is flagged via the STATUS column
  as coincident with an antico event, identified as an electrical or
  recoil crosstalk event, or occurs during MXS operation. The outer 20
  pixels may be excluded from the branching ratios calculation by
  setting the parameter 'pixmask=pixmask.txt'.

</p>

<p>
  For comparison with the grade distribution statistics compiled from
  real or simulated events, statistical estimates are computed and
  output. For these, the count rate is distributed on the array
  according to the file specified by the 'pixfrac' parameter. If
  'pixfrac=NONE' a uniform illumination is assumed.  For pixel 12, the
  calpixel, the rate is set to the value specified in the 'calpixrate'
  parameter. If 'ctphafrac1' and/or 'ctphafrac2' are > 0 crosstalk is
  calculated assuming that any pixel crosstalks with all of its
  nearest and/or next-nearest pixels as defined by the electrical
  proximity calibration map pixmap.fits (set by the parameter
  'ctelpixfile'). The outer 20 pixels may be excluded from the
  branching ratios calculation by setting the parameter
  'pixmask=pixmask.txt'. The fraction of different grades in each
  pixel is assigned using the 'dtmidhigh', 'dtlowmid', and 'dtprimary'
  parameters as described above, and assuming Poisson statistics.
</p>

<p>
  'sxsbranch' can simulate pileup defined as occurring when events in
  a given pixel separated by small intervals cannot be distinguished,
  if the 'flagmerge' parameter is set to yes. This is valid either for
  simulated ('heasim') event input files, or if 'infile=NONE'. In this
  case, events separated in time by intervals smaller than that given
  by the 'dtmerge' parameter are combined into a single event up to a
  total time interval given by the 'dtmax' parameter. If there is a
  'heasim' input file, the energy of the merged event is set equal to
  the sum of energies of the individual events that were merged, and
  the merged event is discarded if the value exceeds that given by the
  'maxenergy' parameter. Crosstalk events are added, and events are
  graded based on the event list after merging.
</p>

<p>
(a) The pixfrac.txt file is used in the statistical estimates, and for
simulating events if 'infile=none'. The file contains the distribution
fraction of the counts in the total array based on the PSF.  (b) The
pixmap.fits file is used when including crosstalk in calculating
branching ratios for 'filetype=sim' or 'infile=none', as well as for the
associated statistical estimates. The file contains information on the
electrical proximity of the pixels necessary to define crosstalk among
pixels.  (c) The pixmask.txt is used to exclude pixels from the
calculation when calculating branching ratios, and for the associated
statistical estimates.
</p>


<p>
  The output of 'sxsbranch' is a FITS file with two extensions with
  identical structure. The first extension, BRANCHEST, contains the
  results of the statistical estimates based on Poisson
  statistics. The second extension, BRANCHCALC, contains the results
  of calculations based on the input data file or count rate. Each
  extension contains a group of keywords providing the results for the
  full array and columns providing the results for each pixel. The
  total rates are obtained considering the sum of good and crosstalk
  events. If the file is from an observation, rather than a
  simulation, the good events do not include: baseline, lost events,
  events where the SLOPE_DIFFER flag is set, any that do not satisfy
  the condition set in the parameters rtmax and dmmin, events flagged
  via the STATUS column as coincident with an antico event, identified
  as an electrical or recoil crosstalk event, or occurring during MXS
  operation. If the file is from a simulation, the good events do not
  include crosstalk. The exposure times for a given pixel and grade
  are calculated by multiplying the total exposure time taken from the
  keyword header by the ratio of RATEGOODxx events in that grade
  (where xx is the grade) to RATEGOOD. The rates and exposure
  fractions per grade are averages over the entire observation.

If the input file is a simulated file from 'heasim', 'sxsbranch' creates a
copy of the input file, adding and filling two columns: PIXEL with the
pixel number, and ITYPE with the grade (ITYPE = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 for HP,
MP, MS, LP, LS, respectively). Additionally, if 'flagmerge=yes' the
PILEUP column in the output events file is set to 1 for merged events
and 0 otherwise.

 event up to a total time interval given by the dtmax parameter, and
 discarded if the sum of their energies exceeds the value given by the
 maxenergy parameter. Crosstalk events are added, and events are
