<h2>NAME</h2>

sgdevtid - Reconstruct SGD events

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>sgdevtid infile outfile remapfile fluorefile badpixfile probseqfile probfovfile </tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p> 
'sgdevtid' determines whether the signals in an occurrence constitute a valid event 
and computes the event energy and the 3-dimensional coordinates of its first interaction. 

The input file to 'sgdevtid' is an SFF file with variable length array 
columns where each row contains an occurrence with multiple signals 
recorded at a given time. The output event file, specified by the parameter 'outfile', 
has a different structure and does not contain columns with variable length arrays.
Each row in the output file corresponds to a reconstructed event and 
the columns 'CAMERAX', 'CAMERAY', 'CAMERAZ', and 'PI' contain the 
reconstructed position and energy of that event along with additional columns 
containing information related to the number and the type of interactions
(see below).

'sgdevtid' has many parameters that are used in the event reconstruction.
These have been optimized and it is advised to use their default settings. 


The algorithm uses the different signals in each occurrence to 
reconstruct an event in a two-step process. 
The first step is to merge the signals
according to their location and whether or not are consistent with 
fluorescence X-ray. 
The second step is to analyze the remaining signals and determine whether 
the sequence is consistent with an event.  
If the algorithm fails, the value of 'PI' is set to 'NULL' and writes
diagnostic columns the reason to why the occurrence
could not be reconstructed.
Below is a more detail description of the algorithm.
<p>

The merging of the different signals depends on what is considered the maximum
distance for these signals to be physically related. This critical distance 
in turn depends on the event geometry.  
The task first merges the multiple adjacent signals (charge sharing) present 
in a single detector layer. The parameter 'd10' defines the meaning of "adjacent" 
and specifies the  critical distance for the merging to occur. 
The next step of the task consists in merging the fluorescence signals into
the originating signal. This step depends critically of the event configuration. 
If both the originating and fluorescence signals
are in the same CdTe layer, the critical distance is
specified by the parameter 'd1a1a', if not, the relevant parameter is called 
 'd1a1b'. 
 If the originating signal is in CdTe but the fluorescence signals are detected
 in a Si layer, the critical distance is now specified by the parameter 'd1a2'. 
If both are in the Si layers, the relevant parameter for the merging becomes 
'd1a3'.  These parameters are hidden in the task and a value recommended by the 
instrument team is assigned by default. 

At this point (one step/merger), the task reconstruction has reached the level 
of "hit". If there is only one hit, the process is done. 
Otherwise, the task now reconstructs the different "hits" until the 
process converges on a single most-likely sequence of hits.

<p> 
The following step depends on the number of reconstructed hits. If there are 
more than 4 hits, the entire occurrence, considered consistent with 
a cosmic ray, is rejected.
If there are between 2 and 4 hits, all the possible permutations for the 
sequence of hits are tried and all sequences with 
non-physical Compton scattering (F-test) are rejected. If only one sequence 
remains, it is deemed to be the actual reconstructed event.
If there are more than one sequence at the end of the first test, subsequent tests
are performed. If the sequences have inconsistent Compton scattering angle and
geometric scattering angle (for 3 or 4 hits; G test) are rejected. 
Uncertainties in geometric scattering angle are computed using the method
specified by the parameter 'delgmethod' (either set to 'analytic' or 'corner').  
The maximum acceptable discrepancy between geometric and Compton scattering angle 
is given by the uncertainty in scattering angle (computed with the method 
specified above) multiplied by the value of the parameter 'b' (set to '1.0' by 
default). 
Again, if only one sequence remains, the process is done and the sequence is 
declared the reconstructed event. 
If all sequences are rejected, the task calculates the escape energy, the 
unabsorbed part of the energy of a photon that is able to exit the camera after
detection, and executes the previous F and G tests (for 3 or 4 hits) again, 
correcting for that effect.
<p> 
A calibration file specified by the 'probseqfile' parameter allows to abandon 
the low-probability sequences. The probability thresholds for
2, 3, and 4 hits are given by parameters probaccept2, probaccept3,
and probaccept4, respectively.

The last step is to rank the remaining sequences by a figure of merit (FOM). 
 The figure-of-merit is an angular resolution measure comparing the
calculated kinematic scattering angle to the 
geometrical scattering angle, which is calculated by assuming that
the incident direction is the line of sight.   
The FOM 
can be tuned using the offset parameters paraoffset0, paraoffset1, paraoffset2,
 and the weighting parameters weight0, weight1, weight2, and weight3. 
 The highest-ranking sequence is then declared the reconstructed event. 
The FOM formulae are given below. 
<br>
If M=2, FOM[k] = (paraoffset0 - G[k,0]) * weight0 + Prob[k] * weight3
<br>
If M=3, FOM[k] = (paraoffset0 - G[k,0]) * weight0 + (paraoffset1 - G[k,1]) * weight1 + Prob[k] * weight3
<br>
If M=4, FOM[k] = (paraoffset0 - G[k,0]) * weight0 + (paraoffset1 - G[k,1]) * weight1 + (paraoffset2 - G[k,2]) * weight2 + Prob[k] * weight3
<p>
 M is the number of hits, 
G[k,n] is the difference between the kinematic angle and the 
geometric angle for hit n, and Prob[k] is read from the calibration file 
specified by the 'probseqfile' parameter.  

<p>
Reconstruction results for each occurrence are in the output file specified
by the 'outfile' parameter.
Columns copied from the input SFF are TIME, OCCURRENCE_ID, CATEGORY,
FLAG_LCHKMIO, FLAG_CCBUSY, FLAG_HITPAT_CC, FLAG_HITPAT, FLAG_FASTBGO, 
FLAG_SEU, FLAG_LCHK, FLAG_CALMODE, FLAG_TRIGPAT, FLAG_TRIG, 
LIVETIME, PROC_STATUS, and STATUS.

NUMHITS: 5-element array giving hit distribution; default value of
each element is zero; element N (N=1,2,3, or 4) is populated with 1 
if there are N or more hits; element 5 is populated with 1 if
escape energy is calculated<br>
SEQ_HITS: descriptor for hit mechanism, from CALDB file given by
'probseqfile' parameter<br>

DISTANCE0: [mm] physical distance between first two hits<br>
OFFAXIS: [deg] difference between Compton and kinematic angles<br>
CAMERAX, CAMERAY, CAMERAZ: [mm] 3-dimensional coordinates of first hit within the Compton camera<br>
LIKELIHOOD:  likelihood of the event<br>
RECO_STATUS: bit flags describing the reconstruction of each occurrence (see below)<br>
MATTYPE: code for the material where the incident photon is detected = 1 for Si,
2 for CdT2, or 3 for multiple layers<br>
