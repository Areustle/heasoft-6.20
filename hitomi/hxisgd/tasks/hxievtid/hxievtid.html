<h2>NAME</h2>

hxievtid -- Reconstructs HXI events


<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>hxievtid infile outfile remapfile fluorefile badpixfile enecutfile</tt> 

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>


'hxievtid' determines whether the signals in an occurrence constitute a valid event 
and computes the event position and the energy deposited in the detector.

The input file to 'hxievtid' is an SFF file with variable length array columns where 
each row contains an occurrence with multiple signals recorded at a given time.
The output event file, specified by the parameter 'outfile', has a different structure and 
do not contain columns with variable length arrays.
 
In this output file, each row corresponds to a reconstructed event and 
the columns 'RAWX', 'RAWY' and 'PI' contain the  reconstructed position and energy 
of that event along with additional columns 
containing other event characteristics, as described below.
<p> 
The HXI consists of five detector layers in a vertical stack: four Si strip detectors
at the top and a single CdTe detector at the bottom.  Each layer is a strip detector
with topside strips running perpendicular to bottom side strips. 
Signals in more than one layer are rejected unless they are reconstructed with 
an X-ray fluorescence event. Signals below the threshold PHA values given in 
badpixfile are not used in the reconstruction. 

The only localization patterns recognized as a valid signal are: 

1. One signal on the top side and one signal on the bottom side.
2. One signal on the top side and two signals in adjacent strips on the bottom side.
3. Two signals in adjacent strips on the top side and one signal on the bottom side.
4. Two signals in adjacent strips on the top side and two signals in adjacent strips 
on the bottom side.

Occurrences with signals matching one of the template patterns in both the CdTe layer 
and one Si layer may be accepted, if the reconstructed energy deposited in the Si layer
is within one of the ranges for a fluorescence X-ray from the CdTe layer.

<p>

The reconstructed energy of an event is computed using the signal
       EPI values calculated in hxisgdpha.  For events occurring in a
       single layer, the event energy (EPI) in keV is taken to be the sum
       of the one or two signals in the top layer for Si or the bottom layer
       for CdTe.  For events with signals in a single Si layer and the
       CdTe layer, the EPI is taken from the one or two bottom layer signals
       in the CdTe layer.  The PI value of the event is calculated using a
       channel size of 0.1 keV.

       The coordinate location (RAWX, RAWY) is evaluated by taking the
       strip number associated with the signal with the larger EPI in both
       top (RAWY) and bottom (RAWX) sides. In the case of an occurrence
       with both signals equally split and having the same EPI, then the
       signal determining the position is chosen randomly.  For events
       with signals in two layers, one on Si and one on CdTe, the position
 this procedure is applied for signals       in the CdTe layer.

<p>
Reconstruction results for each occcurence are in the output file 
specified by the 'outfile' parameter.
Columns copied from the input SFF are TIME, OCCURRENCE_ID, CATEGORY,
FLAG_SEU, FLAG_LCHK, FLAG_TRIG, FLAG_TRIGPAT, FLAG_HITPAT, FLAG_FASTBGO, 
LIVETIME, PROC_STATUS, and STATUS.
<p>
Output file columns populated by the reconstruction are as follows:<br>
EVTCAT: event category = 1 for 'one hit, good', 2-5 for 'two hits, good',
6 for 'energy test failed', 7 for 'two hits, both Si layer', 
8 for 'invalid hit or hits', 9 for 'no hits found', 
10 for 'reconstruction failed, more than two hits,
11 for 'no reconstruction, output set to NULL'<br>
SIGNAL: number of signals per side<br>
SIGPOS: signal position per side (X or Y)<br>
GOODBAD: good (0) or bad (1) flag per side<br>
VALIDHITS: hit validity per layer<br>
LAYER: layer number = 0-3 for Si or 4 for CdTe<br>
ENE_TOTAL: sum of EPI per occurrence<br>
PI:  pulse invariant<br>
RECO_STATUS: bit flags describing the reconstruction of each occurrence (see below)<br>
RAWX, RAWY: HXI RAW pixel coordinates of each reconstructed event<br>
EPITOP: total EPI for top layers<br>
EPIBOT: total EPI for bottom layers<br>
EPICUT: code for energy cut = 0 for OK, 1 for 'exclude high', 2 for 'exclude low',
3 for 'no signal', 4 for 'below threshold', or -999 as a null value<br>
<p>Additional coordinate columns are added to the file but populated later by 
task 'coordevt': ACTX, ACTY, DETX, DETY, FOCX, FOCY, X, and Y.
<p>The bit flags in the RECO_STATUS (reconstruction status) column are as follows:<br>
<pre>

  0    Mode is Am 241
