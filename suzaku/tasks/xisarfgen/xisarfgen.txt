DESCRIPTION

    'xisarfgen' outputs an ARF that contains effective area of the XIS system
    except the detection efficiency. 'xisarfgen' is designed to calculate ARFs
    for a point-like source using pre-calculated files (via ray-tracing) in
    the CALDB. This is usually much faster than 'xissimarfgen', which always
    carries out ray-tracing. The different method of the calculation makes
    small difference between the effective areas in the ARFs produced by
    'xissimarfgen' and 'xisarfgen', which is reported in Suzaku MEMO-2011-01.

    Difference between 'xissimarfgen' and 'xisarfgen' is summarized as follows:

    Users can calculate the ARF with 'xisarfgen' more quickly than with
    'xissimarfgen'.  If users ignore the error of the pointing control in
    one observation ("attitude=none"), the ARF can be generated in a minute.
    If users takes into the pointing error (attitude=filename), the ARF can be
    generated in a few hours, depending on the amount of the attitude wobbling
    during the observation.

PARAMETERS

phafile [filename]
    Name of the input spectrum or event file to get observation mode.
    If "NONE", WINOPT=0, WIN_ST=0, WIN_SIZ=1024, and CI=0,
    i.e. window off and SCI off, are assumed.

(teldef = CALDB) [filename]
    Teldef file appropriate for the XIS unit chosen for the arf generation.
    This file is automatically read from the calibration database.

(leapfile = CALDB;$ENV{LHEA_DATA}/leapsec.fits) [file name]
    Name of the leap second file. The default value is set to
    indicate that 'xissimarfgen' will search for the file in CALDB first
    and then in the LHEA_DATA directory if necessary (the actual path
    for the HEADAS installation in use will be shown).

(pointing = AUTO) [string]
    Pointing type. This parameter is used when the "source_mode" is set
    to SKYXY or the "region_mode" is SKYFITS, SKYREG or SKYCIRC. The allowed
    values are AUTO or USER. If set to USER the parameters "ref_alpha",
    "ref_delta" and "ref_roll" are also prompt. If set to AUTO and an attitude
    file (parameter "attitude") is provided the parameters "ref_alpha",
    "ref_delta", "ref_roll" are not prompt. If set to AUTO and no
    attitude is provided the reference are from the Euler angle parameters
    "ea1", "ea2" and "ea3".

    R.A. of the sky reference position.
    This must be specified if "pointing=USER".

ref_delta [real]

    This must be specified if "pointing=USER".

source_mode [string]
    Source mode. The allowed values are J2000, SKYXY,
    If set to SKYXY, the pixel position either in the sky X/Y
    coordinates should be entered in the parameters "source_x" and "source_y".
    If set to J2000, the RA and Dec in degrees should be entered in the
    parameters "source_ra" and "source_dec".

source_ra [real]
    Source position R.A. (deg). Used when "source_mode" is J2000.

    Number of regions for which the ARF is generated.

region_mode [string]
    Region mode. The allowed values are SKYFITS, SKYREG, and SKYCIRC.
    If SKYFITS, a sky or detector coordinates image should be entered
    in the parameter "regfileN". In order to specify an extraction region,
    pixel values should set to 1 inside the region, and set to 0 outside.
    If SKYREG, a region (ds9 format) in the sky X/Y pixel coordinates
    should be entered in the parameter "regfileN".
    If SKYCIRC, a file is not required and it is possible to enter either
    a circular or annulus region using the parameters "region_xN",
    "region_yN", region_rminN" and "region_rmaxN" to specify the center of
    the region and the radii.

regfile1-9 [filename]
    Region file #1-9. This is used when the "region_mode" is set to SKYFITS
    or SKYREG. The region file can be either a FITS image file or an ASCII
    region file (ds9 format). If the region is input as an image fits file
    ("region_mode" set to SKYFITS) the size of the image should be in the
    unbinned coordinates, (e,g, 1536x1536 for X and Y, SKYFITS).
    The WMAP image in the primary header of a spectrum file is also usable.

    This is the maximum radius for an annulus region or
    the radius for a circular region.
