NAME
    xispi -- calculate the XIS PI and grade values from PHAS
 
USAGE
    xispi infile outfile hkfile

DESCRIPTION

    'xispi' calculates the pulse invariant (PI) value associated to each
    XIS event and grades the events accordingly with the patterns in the
    PHAS column.

    The task first reconstructs the pulse height distribution partly
    distorted through the vertical or horizontal CCD pixel transfer
    (charge trail correction). It then adds up event pulse heights of
    each event in the PHAS array and recovers its pulse height lost in
    the CCD pixel transfer (cti correction). This values is written in
    the PHA column. The final PI value is calculated by gain correcting
    the PHA. The gain correction uses the detector gain table in CALDB
    (ae_<ins>_makepi_YYYYMMDD.fits) and the temperature read from the
    detector HK file.  The task also classifies each event by the ASCA
    grades from the 3x3 pixel patterns.

    'xispi' uses a constant split threshold of 20 ADU for the FI chips and
    a build-in "energy" dependent split threshold for the BI chip. These
    are the default values used to calibrate the detectors. The default
    split threshold can be changed using the parameters 'flag_constant_spth'
    and 'constant_spth'. 'flag_constant_spth' allows to change split
    threshold from energy-dependent to constant. NOTE the energy-dependent
    method is currently only applicable to the BI chip, changing this flag
    when correcting FI data will not have any effect. 'constant_spth' is
    the constant split threshold. The default is set to 20.
 
PARAMETERS

infile [filename]
    input event FITS file.

outfile [filename]
    Name of output event fits file.

hkfile [filename]
    Name of input XIS HK file.

(makepifile = CALDB) [filename]
    Gain correction file. This file is located in CALDB and by
    default retrieved automatically from CALDB.
    The CALDB filename is ae_<ins>_makepi_YYYYMMDD.fits where <ins>
    is a string set to xi0, xi1, xi2, xi3 indicating the sensor and
    YYYYMMDD is the release date.

(ignore_frames = yes) [boolean]
    Flag to ignore FRAMES extension

(enable_trcor = yes) [boolean]
    Flag to enable charge trail correction

(enable_cticor = yes) [boolean]
    Flag to enable CTI correction

(enable_scicti = yes) [boolean]
    Flag to enable CTI correction for SCI

(flag_constant_spth = no) [boolean]
    Flag if the constant split threshold method is applied
    (yes: constant split threshold, no: the "energy" dependent split).
    NOTE for FI chip is not possible to apply "energy" dependent split.
    By default the constant split threshold method is instead used. 

(constant_spth = 20) [integer]
    Value of the split threshold, when the constant method is selected.

(enable_edge_smooth = yes) [boolean]
    Flag to enable smoothing the PHA to PI relation around edge

(flag_rand_phas0 = yes) [boolean]
    Flag to randomize PHAS[0]

(rand_seed = 7) [integer]
    random number seed

(rand_skip = 0.0) [real]
    random number skip count

(hk_time_margin = 3600) [real]
    time margin in second to consider AE-temp is valid

(hk_aetemp_min = -30) [real]
    minimum value in degC to consider AE-temp is valid

(hk_aetemp_max = +40) [real]
    maximum value in degC to consider AE-temp is valid

(num_event = -1) [integer]
    number of event (-1: all, 0: exit)

(event_freq = 1000) [integer]
    Event number printout frequency

(anl_verbose = -1) [integer]
    ANL verbose level (-1: full, 0: minimum)

(anl_profile = yes) [boolean]
    Enable ANL module profiling

(chatter = 2) [integer]
    message chatter level (0: min, 2: norm, 5: max)


EXAMPLES

1.  Calculate the PI and grade values for the event file
    ae20041215_1055_1932_xis0_5x5.fff using HK data in
    "hkfile" and utilizing the constant split threshold of 20,
    and create the new event file ae20041215_1055_1932_xis0_5x5_uf.sff

    %  xispi infile=ae20041215_1055_1932_xis0_5x5.fff \
             outfile=ae20040822_1425_1248_xis0_5x5_uf.sff \
             hkfile=ae20040822_1425_1248_xis0.fits \
             flag_constant_spth=1 \
             constant_spth=20

2.  Calculate the PI and grade values for the event file
    ae20041215_1055_1932_xis1_5x5.fff using HK data in
    hkfile and utilizing the PHA-dependent split threshold,
    and create the new event file ae20041215_1055_1932_xis1_5x5_uf.sff

    %  xispi infile=ae20041215_1055_1932_xis1_5x5.fff \
