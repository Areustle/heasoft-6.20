DESCRIPTION

    'xisrmfgen' creates an XIS RMF file fit for a Suzaku pha file or 
    any parameters affecting the instrumental response such as the XIS
    units, CCD clock modes, observation date, and so on. 'xisrmfgen'
    calculates a line profile of monochromatic X-rays at each energy
    bins with energy between the event threshold up to the energy with
    x0.01 of the probability at the event threshold energy.

    The information required to calculate the RMF (XIS unit, CCD clock mode,
    telemetry edit mode, charge injection mode, and observation date) are
    obtained in a different way, depending on how the parameter 'phafile'
    is set.

    If 'phafile' is set to an existing input spectrum or image file,
    the XIS instrument unit, CCD clock mode, telemetry edit mode,
    window option, and change injection mode are obtained from the keywords
    INSTRUME, CLK_MODE, EDITMODE, WINOPT, and CI, respectively.

    The observation date is calculated from the TSTART and TSTOP keywords
    as (TSTART + TSTOP)/2. Note that 'xisrmfgen' also requires in the
    calculation a weighted map in DET coordinates. Therefore the primary
    header of the spectral file should contain a WMAP in DET coordinates
    and the image file also should be constructed in the same DET coordinates.

    If 'phafile' is set to NONE, the information required by xisrmfgen to
    generate the RMF is prompt via the following parameters 'instrume',
    'clk_mode', 'editmode', 'winopt', 'ci', and 'date_obs'. Note these
    parameters are ignored (not asked) when a file is input. The WMAP in
    this case is assumed uniform on the whole CCD.

    The energy bin of the RMF by default are set with a constant width of
    2 eV within the energy range 0.2-16 keV (see parameter ebin_mode=0).
    The width and the energy range can be changed using the parameters
    'ebin_width', 'ebin_lowermost,and 'ebin_uppermost' for a constant
    binning.  If the parameter 'ebin_mode' is set to 1, energy bin width
    may not be constant. In this case the lower and high energy boundaries
    for each bin are read from an ARF or RMF input loaded from the ebinfile
    option.

    There are so called 'Si edge problem' around the Si-K edge (Ka=1.7398 keV)
    particularly for the BI sensor (XIS1), namely, there remains systematic
    residuals in spectral fits around the edge. In order to solve the problem,
    followings are implemented since xisrmfgen version 2012-04-21,
      - Equalize the energy resolutions of main and sub-components
      - Introduce a discontinuous change of ratio among components
    and they are activated when the parameter 'bi_si_edge_mode' is set to 1
    (default). These modifications are implemented only for BI. However,  
    the parameter 'fi_si_edge_mode' is also added for possible future use,
    and it should be set to 0.


PARAMETERS

phafile [filename]
    Name of the input file. The input file can be a spectrum or image file.
    If set to 'NONE' the task calculates the response based on the input
    parameters: 'instrume', 'clk_mode', 'editmode', 'winopt', 'ci', and
    'date_obs'.

outfile [filename]
    Name of output RMF.

(rebin = 1) [integer]
    Rebinning factor. The default is set to 1.
    For higher rebinning use even values (2,4,8...).

(clobber = yes) [boolean]
    Overwrite output file if exists.

(telescop=SUZAKU) [string]
    Telescope name. This should be set always to SUZAKU.
    Used when phafile='NONE'.

    Date and time of the observation. The format can be Suzaku TIME
    (time in seconds from the mission start) or UTC 'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sss'.
    This parameter is required when phafile='NONE'.

    CCD clock mode (normal, burst or psum).
    This parameter is required when phafile='NONE'.

    %  xisrmfgen  phafile=src_xis1.pi  outfile=xis1.rmf

2.  Create a response file (src_xis1.rmf), corresponding to the input detector     image file `src_xis1.img'. The energy bins are read from the input ARF 
    file `ae_xi1_xisnom6_20060615.arf'.

    %  xisrmfgen  phafile=src_xis1.img  outfile=xis1.rmf  ebin_mode=1 \

BUGS

    'xisrmfgen' generates the same RMF files for the burst mode as
    those for the normal mode since we found no remarkable difference
    in response between the burst mode and the normal mode. Detailed 
    quantitative studies of the response in the burst mode is underway.
    
    'xisrmfgen' also generates the same RMF file for a window option
    as for data with the identical observing and instrumental parameters
    but without the window option. However, please note that the gain and
    resolution of the window option can be slightly different from those
    without that option.

    'xisrmfgen' generates the same RMF files for the 2x2 mode data as
    those for the 5x5/3x3 mode data since we found no remarkable
    difference in response between the 2x2 mode data and the 5x5/3x3
    mode data.
