GTISYNCH (Apr06)            suzaku.gtisynch          GTISYNCH (Apr06)



NAME
    GTISYNCH  --  Modifies/Adjusts  GTI  START  and  END   time   stamps 
    depending  upon  the  values  of  the time frames in the input event
    file(s).
    
    
    
USAGE
       gtisynch eventfile gtifile out_gtifile frac_exposure
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    GTISYNCH uses the time frames in the input  event  files  to  modify
    and adjust the GTI intervals in the GTI file
    
    The  CCD-based  instruments  collect  data  in  exposures  which are
    several seconds long. If the starts and stops of GTIs occur  in  the
    middle  of  a CCD exposure period, this tool will try to adjust them
    to either the beginning or end of the time frame in the event file.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    eventfile [string]
        The file name and the extension of the input  event  fits  file.
        If  the  file  name  is  preceded  with a @, it is a ASCII file,
        which contains the list of the event file  name/extensions,  one
        per each line.
    
    
    gtifile [string]
        The file name and the extension of the input GTI fits file.
    
    
    outfile [string]
        The  output  gti  file. If it has the same name as the input gti
        file, it will be appended to or  overwrite  the  original  file,
        depending on whether the clobber parameter is set.
    
    
    expofrac [real]
        The fraction of the exposure to be included in a GTI.
    
    
    (begin = "FRAME_ST_AETIMES") [string] 
        Column containing frame begin times in event extension.
    
    
    (end = "FRAME_END_AETIMES") [string] 
        Column containing frame end  times in event extension.
    
    
    (frames_ext = "FRAMES") [string] 
        The name of extension containing frames.
    
    
    (start = "START") [string] 
        Column containing GTI start times in input GTI extension.
    
    
    (stop = "STOP") [string] 
        Column containing GTI stop times in input GTI extension.
    
    
    (gti_ext = "STDGTI") [string] 
        The name of extension containing gtis.
    
    
    (clobber = "yes") [string] 
        Delete outfile if it exists?
    
    
    
EXAMPLES 
    
    
        1.  Adjust  the  GTI  file  orig_gti.fits   using the event file
        event.fits and    expofrac = 0.1. The  results  are  written  to
        the file mod_gti.fits.
    
             gtisynch event.fits+1 orig_gti.fits+1 mod_gti.fits 0.1
    
        2.  Adjust  the  GTI  file   orig_gti.fits using the events file
        listed    in list.lis  and  expofrac  =  0.1.  The  results  are
        written to the    file mod_gti.fits.
    
             gtisynch @list.lis orig_gti.fits+1 mod_gti.fits 0.1
    
           The events files are listed in the list.lis.
