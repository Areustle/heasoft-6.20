NAME
    aemkreg (version 6.1) --- a script that creates a ds9 format region
    file (output to STDOUT) for given satellite Euler angles.

USAGE
    aemkreg [-xis] [-hxd] [-xrs] Euler1 Euler2 Euler3
    where Euler1,2,3 are the satellite Euler angles in degree.

DESCRIPTION
    This script creates a ds9 format region file (output to STDOUT)
    for given satellite Euler angles.  Approximate XIS and HXD fields of
    view are drawn by default, and with options, any combinations of
    XIS, HXD, and XRS field of views can be generated. The HXD FOV box regions
    represent FWHM square openings defined by the passive fine collimator.

    In Suzaku, Z-axis roughly corresponds to the pointing direction,
    and we adopt Z-Y-Z rotation for the Euler angle definition.
    Consequently, (Euler1, 90.0-Euler2) is the equatorial coordinates
    of the nominal pointing direction, and (90-Euler3) gives
    the roll angle that is measured from North to DETY axis
    in the counter-clockwise direction.  The HXD preferred position
    (DETX,DETY) = (-3.5',0.0') is also displayed.

BUGS
    This script gives only rough estimate of the pointing direction,
    and the telescope definition (teldef) files are required for more
    accurate sensor alignments.  The 'aecoordcalc' ftool is provided
    for such purposes.
