  <h2>NAME</h2>
  aeattcor2 - Creates a corrected Suzaku attitude file based on mean event
  positions as a function of time.

  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <tt>aeattcor2 &lt;attfile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt; &lt;evtfile&gt; &lt;regionfile&gt;</tt>

  <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
  <p>The Suzaku task <tt>aeattcor</tt> corrects Suzaku attitude data for
  the effects of "thermal wobbling" caused by thermal distortions of the
  satellite bodies. See <tt>fhelp aeattcor</tt> for more information on
  that tool.

  <p>This tool (<tt>aeattcor2</tt>) further corrects the attitude data for
  thermal wobbling using mean event positions as a function of time.

  <p>aeattcor2 performs the following steps to produce a corrected attitude
  file:<br>
  <ol>
   <li>Runs <tt>fcurve</tt> to create a time series of the mean X and Y
   positions of events within the input region (see <tt>regionfile</tt>
   parameter). The time series will have <tt>integ_time</tt> second wide
   bins.</li>

   <li>Runs <tt>ftselect</tt> to filter out under-exposed time series bins
   (see <tt>minfrexp</tt> parameter).</li>

   <li>Calculates the overall mean X and Y event position, optionally using sigma
   clipping (see <tt>clipmean</tt>, <tt>clipsigma</tt> and
   <tt>clipiter</tt> parameters).</li>

   <li>Calculates the angular offset from the mean position as a function of
   time, and interpolates these differences onto the input attitude file and
   adjusts attitude euler angles accordingly.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
  NOTE: This tool does not change the input attitude, or input event files. It
  is left to the user to re-run the <tt>xiscoord</tt> Suzaku tool with the
  corrected attitude file.

  <h2>CAVEATS</h2>
  <p>Only screened (clean) events should be used as input to this tool, and the
  region (see <tt>regionfile</tt> parameter) should be centered on a single
  source (preferably bright).

  <h2>PARAMETERS</h2>

  <dl>
   <dt>attitude [string]
   <dd>Name of input attitude file.

   <p>
   <dt>outfile [string]
   <dd>Name of corrected output attitude file. This can be used to correct
   event positions with the <tt>xiscoord</tt> Suzaku ftool.

   <p>
   <dt>eventfile [string]
   <dd>Name of input event file to use for correction. This should be a screened
   XIS event file.

   <p>
   <dt>regionfile [string]
   <dd>Name of region file to use when selecting events for mean position
   calculation. Any format recognized by the CFITSIO library's "regfilter"
   functionality can be used. The region should be centered on a reasonably
   bright source (does not need to be a point source).

   <p>A value of 'NONE' will cause no region filtering to be used.

   <p>
   <dt>(integ_time) [real]
   <dd>Integration time (seconds) over which mean event positions will be
   calculated.

   <p>
   <dt>(gtifile) [string]
   <dd>Name of additional GTI file to use in filtering events. Enter 'NONE'
   for no additional GTI filtering.

   <p>
   <dt>(savexycurve) [bool]
   <dd>Save time-series of mean X/Y event positions, and Euler angle offsets?

   <p>
   <dt>(xycurve) [string]
   <dd>Name of output file to contain time-series of mean X/Y event positions
   and Euler angle offsets.

   <p>
   <dt>(minfrexp) [real]
   <dd>Minimum fractional exposure to include when calculating mean event
   positions.

   <p>
   <dt>(clipmean) [bool]
   <dd>Calculate overall mean event positions using sigma clipping? The amount
   of clipping used can be controlled with the <tt>clipsigma</tt> and
   <tt>clipiter</tt> parameters. See <tt>fhelp ftstat</tt> for more
   details.

   <p>
   <dt>(clipsigma) [real]
   <dd>Number of sigma to clip (see <tt>clipmean</tt> parameter).

   <p>
   <dt>(clipiter) [int]
   <dd>Maximum number of clipping iterations (see <tt>clipmean</tt>
   parameter).

   <p>
   <dt>(cleanup) [bool]
   <dd>Remove temporary files?

   <p>
   <dt>(chatter) [0,5]
   <dd>Terminal chat level. 0 =&gt; no chatter; 5 =&gt; debugging

   <p>
   <dt>(clobber) [bool]
   <dd>Overwrite existing output files?

   <p>
   <dt>(history) [bool]
   <dd>Add history keywords?

  </dl>

  This tool is based heavily on the ISIS script aeattcor.sl by John Davis. See:
