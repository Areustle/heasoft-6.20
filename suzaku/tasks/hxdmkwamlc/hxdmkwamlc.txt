NAME
        hxdmkwamlc -- extract light curves from HXD-WAM TRN data

USAGE
        hxdmkwamlc input_name outroot 
        
DESCRIPTION
        This task creates a single light curve for each WAM detector from one 
        WAM event fits file. The light curves are obtained from information of
        Pulse Height(PH) data which has 55 energy channels (0 to 54) or other 
        counters information such as lower and upper discriminators. The 
        deadtime correction is selectable with an option of "dt_cor". 

PARAMETERS
(read_iomode = readonly)          
        HXD WAM fits input I/O mode. Always readonly. .

(time_change = y)             
        HXD WAM fits update TIME : y or n 

(pi_change = n)              
        HXD WAM fits update PI : y or n

(quality_change = n)              
        HXD WAM fits update GRADE : y or n. 

(gtimode = y)             
        HXD WAM fits using GTI : y or n. 

(gti_time = S_TIME)          
        HXD WAM fits using time : TIME or S_TIME. 

leapfile [filename]
        Input leap-seconds file including the path. This file is located
        in the HEADAS refarea. See enviroment variable $LHEA_DATA. 

input_name [filename]

outroot [filename]
        Root name for output file.

(tpu_board = -1)
        HXD WAM detector number (-1=all, 0, 1, 2, 3).

(ph_mode = 1)
        Pulse Height (PH) data or other data(0:others, 1:PH).

(min_channel = 0)
        Minimum channel number [0-54]. 

(max_channel = 54) 
        Maximum channel number [0-54]. 

(dt_cor = y)
        Perform a deadtime correction?: y or n. 

(dt_clk = 12.8e-6)
        Deadtime clock frequency.

(origin)
        Values indicate the ORIGIN of the file.

(num_event = -1)              
        number of event (-1=all, 0=exit)

(event_freq = 10000)           
        Event number printout frequency.

(anl_verbose = -1)
        ANL verbose level (-1:full, 0:minimum).

(anl_profile = yes)
        Enable ANL module profiling.
	
(chatter = 2)               
	Message chatter level (0:min, 2:norm, 5:max)


EXAMPLES

1.       Extract the deadtime-corrected WAM light curve of PH data 
        in all the energy band for all the WAM detectors from the WAM
        event files named "ae20040824_1853_1959_hxd_wam.uff".
