NAME
        hxdmkbstlc -- extract light curves from HXD-WAM BST data

USAGE
        hxdmkbstlc input_name outroot tpu_board th_mode 

DESCRIPTION
        This task creates light curves for each WAM detector from one BST 
        event fits file. The light curves are obtained from Time History (TH) 
        data with a fine time resolution(1/32 sec or 1/64 sec), but coarse 
        four energy channels or Pulse Height(PH) data which has a coarse time 
        resolution of 0.5 sec or 1 sec, but 55 fine energy channels (0 to 54). 
        The dead-time correction is supported for both the PH and TH data. 

PARAMETERS
(read_iomode = readonly)          
        HXD BST fits input I/O mode -- Always readonly. 

input_name  [filename]
        HXD BST fits file name.

outroot   [filename]
        Root name for output file.

tpu_board = -1
        WAM detector number (-1=all, 0,1,2,3)

th_mode = 1 
        Pulse Height data (PH) data or Time History (TH) data (0:PH, 1:TH)

(dt_cor = no)
        Perform a deadtime correction?: yes or no
        Note that the deadtime correction for the TH data is currently at 
        the testing stage.

(dt_clk = 12.8e-6)
        Deadtime clock frequency. The default value is set at 12.8 micro 
        seconds. 

(dt_ph = 13.0e-6)
        Deadtime for the PH data. The approximate measured deadtime is 13.0 
        micro seconds. 

(energy_mode = -1)
        The light curve production mode for energy channels (-1:All channels,
        0:One channel, 1:Accumurated channels)            
 
(energy_channel = 2)
        Energy channel for the one-channel production mode.  

(min_channel = 0) 
        Minimum energy channel for the accumurated-channel production mode. 

(max_channel = 1)
        Maximum energy channel for the accumurated-channel production mode. 

(origin = hxdmkbstlc)
        Values indicate the ORIGIN of the file.

(num_event = -1)              
        number of event (-1=all, 0=exit).

(event_freq = 10000)           
        Event number printout frequency.

(anl_verbose = -1)
        ANL verbose level (-1:full, 0:minimum).

(anl_profile = yes)
        Enable ANL module profiling

EXAMPLES

1.      Extract the BST TH light curves in all the 4 energy bands 
        for all the WAM detectors from the WAM
        event files named "ae20040824_1853_1959_hxd_bst01.uff".

        % hxdmkbstlc input_name="ae20040824_1853_1959_hxd_bst01.uff" \
                outroot="ae20040824_1853_1959" tpu_board=-1 th_mode=1 \
                energy_mode=-1 dt_cor=no

2.      Extract the BST PH deadtime-corrected light curves in the 2-54 channel 
        for all the WAM detectors from the WAM
        event files named "ae20040824_1853_1959_hxd_bst01.uff".

        % hxdmkbstlc input_name="ae20040824_1853_1959_hxd_wam.uff" \
                outroot="ae20040824_1853_1959" tpu_board=-1 th_mode=1 \
                energy_mode=1 min_channel=2 max_channel=54 dt_cor=yes
