NAME
    xisnxbgen -- estimate the non X-ray background spectrum or image of XIS

USAGE
    xisnxbgen outfile phafile region_mode regfile orbit attitude

DESCRIPTION

    'xisnxbgen' estimates the non X-ray background (NXB) spectrum or image
    of XIS, by means of the weighted sum of the night Earth observations.
    Details of methods and reproducibility are described in Tawa et al (2008).
    Default indicator of the NXB is COR2 (revised cut-off rigidity) in the
    extended HK (EHK) file made by 'aemkehk'. Other indicators can be usable,
    e.g., obsolete cut-off rigidity COR, or PINUD rate in combination with
    'aemkpinudhk'.

    Because the NXB database (night Earth observation event file) for each
    XIS sensor (XIS0, XIS1, XIS2 and XIS3) is common, event files of 5x5 and
    3x3 editing modes should be merged together before applying 'xisnxbgen'.
    The 5x5 mode event file can be converted into the 3x3 mode event file by
    'xis5x5to3x3'. XSELECT can handle both files together, however PHAS column
    of the 5x5 event files is broken when one would extract and save events.

    In order to catch up with the latest calibration, 'xisnxbgen' automatically
    applys 'xispi', 'xisputpixelquality', and 'cleansis' to the NXB database.
    This feature may be disabled by setting the "apply_xisftools=no".
    The GRADE selection can be done with the "grades" parameter, and the
    pixel quality (or STATUS column) selection is done with the "pixq_min",
    "pixq_max", "pixq_and", and "pixq_eql" parameters. See help file of
    'xisputpixelquality' for details of the definition.

    Considering possible long-term change of the NXB and the steady decay of
    the 55Fe calibration isotope (2.73 year half-life), 'xisnxbgen' extracts
    events from the NXB database between (TSTART - 150 days) and (TSTOP + 150
    days) of the input PHA file specified by the "phafile" parameter,
    by default. This time window may be changed by the "time_min" and
    "time_max" parameters. 'xisnxbgen' also detect whether the observation
    is done in Spaced-row Charge Injection ON (SCI-on) or SCI-off automatically
    with the CI header keyword, and switches the NXB database.

    In estimating the NXB spectrum, one can specify the accumulation region
    in the same way as 'xissimarfgen' with parameters of "region_mode",
    "regfile", and "detmask". The accumulation region may be specified in
    SKY coordinates (region_mode=SKYFITS/SKYREG/SKYEXPR) as well as the
    DET coordinates (region_mode=DETFITS/DETREG/DETEXPR). However,
    implementation of the SKY coordinate extraction is *** EXPERIMENTAL ***,
    and 'xisnxbgen' does not suppose large changes in the spacecraft attitude
    during the observation. The AREASCAL, BACKSCAL, and CORRSCAL keywords
    are copied from the input PHA file to the output spectrum file.
    EXPOSURE is set to the effective value, so that square root of the total
    count is equal to the statistical error of the total count.

    In estimating the NXB image, one can specify the energy range by the
    hidden parameters of "pi_min" and "pi_max". Note that energy scale of
    XIS is set to 3.65 eV/PI-ch, corresponding to the band-gap energy of Si.
    Strictly speaking, PI = 0 ch correspond to 0.0 <= E < 3.65 eV.
    These parameters do not affect the estimation of the NXB spectrum.
    The accumulation region by the "regfile" parameter is ignored, while
    the "detmask" parameter is considered in the NXB image estimation.
    The estimated NXB image in DET coordinates is always appended to the next
    extension of the NXB spectrum in the same output file specified by the
    "outfile" parameter. When region_mode=SKYFITS/SKYREG/SKYEXPR, the SKY
    coordinate image of the estimated NXB is appended to the next extension.
    This is a simple projection of the DET coordinate image to SKY coordinates
    in the same way as the 'xisexpmapgen'.

    After the XIS0 anomaly in 23 June 2009, we apply an area discrimination
    (AD) to all the XIS0 data starting from June 27, 2009 16:27 (UT).
    The discriminated area is in the segment A, covering about 1/8 of the
    entire chip. If (a) the duration covers after the XIS0 anomaly event
    and the subsequent AD operation, and (b) the source extraction region
    includes the AD-ed region, the resultant NXB spectrum may become
    inappropriate. See the web page of
    http://www.astro.isas.jaxa.jp/suzaku/analysis/xis/xis0_area_discriminaion/
    for details.
