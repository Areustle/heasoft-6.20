NAME
    xisputpixelquality -- put pixel quality code (PIXEL_QUALITY or STATUS)
                          for each XIS event
 
USAGE
    xisputpixelquality infile outfile
 
DESCRIPTION
 
    Put pixel quality code (PIXEL_QUALITY or STATUS) for each XIS
    event. The pixel quality code is defined in XISputPixelQuality.h
    as follows. Note that logical OR is applied to the pixel quality code of
    each pixel.  Note also that hotpixels identified in the Dark
    Init/Update mode in the XIS DE onboard software are NOT taken into
    account in the current version of the xisputpixelquality.

PARAMETERS

infile [filename]
    Input event FITS file.

outfile [filename]
    Name of output event fits file.

(ignore_frames = yes) [boolean]
    Flag to ignore the FRAMES extension.

(enable_scipixq = yes) [boolean]
    Flag to enable SCI pixel quality bits.

(badcolumfile = CALDB) [filename]
    Input file that describes the XIS bad columns and flickering pixels. 
    This file is generally located in CALDB, and the file name is 
    ae_<ins>_badcolum_YYYYMMDD.fits where <ins> is a string set to indicate 
    the sensor name (xi0, xi1, xi2, xi3) and YYYYMMDD is the release date.

(calmaskfile = CALDB) [filename]
    Input file that describes the irradiation area of the 55Fe
    calibration source on XIS CCD. This file is located in CALDB. 
    The name is ae_<ins>_calmask_YYYYMMDD.fits where <ins>
    is a string set to xi0, xi1, xi2, xi3 indicating the sensor and
    YYYYMMDD is the release date.

(anl_verbose = -1) [integer]
    ANL verbose level (-1:full, 0:minimum)

(anl_profile = yes) [boolean]
    Enable ANL module profiling

(num_event = -1) [integer]
    number of event (-1:all, 0:exit)

(event_freq = 10000) [integer]     
    Event number printout frequency

(chatter = 2) [integer]
    message chatter level (0:min, 2:norm, 5:max)


EXAMPLES

1.  Read position information of each event from the EVENTS extension
    of the input file, ae20050914_1728_1929_xis0_3x3.fff, and 
    put a pixel quality code in PIXEL_QUALITY column (or STATUS column) 
    in the newly created output file, 
    ae20050914_1728_1929_xis0_3x3_uf.sff. The definition of the pixel 
    quality code is summarized above. Locations of bad CTE columns,
    flickering pixels are written in the CALDB file, 
    ae_xi0_badcolumn_20051003.fits. Calibration source area on the XIS CCD
    is defined in the CALDB file, ae_xi0_calmask_20050802.fits.
    Note that xisputpixelquality does not have a function to search for
    bad columns or flikering pixels. 

    % xisputpixelquality infile=ae20050914_1728_1929_xis0_3x3.fff \
                         outfile=ae20050914_1728_1929_xis0_3x3_uf.sff
