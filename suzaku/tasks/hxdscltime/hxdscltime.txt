NAME
	hxdscltime -- fill the TIME column for the SCL extension in HK FITS.

USAGE
	hxdscltime input_name tim_filename leapfile hklist_name
		
DESCRIPTION

	Carry out HXD event arrival-time correction. Arrival time of each
	column 'TIME' in SCL extension of HK FITS is calculated from 
	'HXD_SCL_TIME' (24-bit time counter in HXD-AE WPU) and 'TI'(DP time),
	by referring to the 'HXD_WPU_CLK_RATE' (clock rate of the counter, 
	HXD_SCL_TIME), 'HXD_TLATCH_TIME' ('TI' at the origin of DP), and 
	'HXD_AE_TM_LATCH_TM' (latched value in HXD-AE) columns in the HK 
	extension.

	In addtion the hxdscltime measure the actual time resolution of 
	'TIME' during the observation to revice the 'TIMEDEL' keyword. 

PARAMETERS

(gtimode = y)             
	HXD scl fits using GTI : y or n ?

(gti_time = SCL_AETIME)          
	HXD event fits using time : TIME or SCL_AETIME
	'HXD_SCL_AETIME' means the time when the SCL packet is created
	in HXD-DE, and 'TIME' is the time when the SCL information are
	gathered in HXD-AE.

input_name [filename]
	HXD HK FITS file name to achive the time correction.

hklist_name [filename]
	HXD HK fits file or @list ASCII file where the HXD HK filenames 
        are listed one per line.

leapfile [filename]
        Input leap-seconds file including the path. This file is located
        in the HEADAS refarea. See enviroment variable $LHEA_DATA.        
        If the value is set to "CALDB", the tool automatically access the 
        latest leapsec file in the HEADAS area.

tim_filename [filename]
        TIM File name, used for the time conversion from TI to aetime.

(time_convert_mode = 4)               
	HxdTime2aetime mode.: 1, 2, 3, 4
        1: use internal function in interpolation (TI to aetime).
        2: use telemetry aetime, and simply add sub_aetime
        3: use telemetry aetime, and interpolate event aetime
	4: use astetool, aste_ti2time() with tim FITS file.

(num_event = -1)              
	number of event (-1=all, 0=exit)

(event_freq = 10000)           
	Event number printout frequency

(anl_verbose = -1)
	ANL verbose level (-1:full, 0:minimum)

(anl_profile = yes)
	Enable ANL module profiling

(chatter = 2)               
        message chatter level (0:min, 2:norm, 5:max)

EXAMPLES

1.	Calculate arrival time 'TIME' for SCL extension in HK FITS, 
	"ae20041215_1055_1932_hxd.hk" using HK FITS files listed in 
	"hk.list", TIM file named "ae20041215_1055_1341.tim" and
	leapsec FITS named "leapsec.fits":

	%  hxdscltime input_name="ae20041215_1055_1932_hxd.hk" \
		leapfile="leapsec.fits" \
		hklist_name="@hk.list" \
		tim_filename="ae20041215_1055_1341.tim"
