NAME
    xisgtigen -- Generate a FITS file of good time interval (GTI) that
                 does not suffer from telemetry saturation

USAGE
    xisgtigen infile outfile

DESCRIPTION

    'xisgtigen' generates a FITS file with a list of time interval (GTI) that
    does not suffer from telemetry saturation, when events in an XIS CCD frame
    in the input event file -- output of the digital processor (DP) -- are the
    same number as those counted with the XIS digital electronics (DE).

    The input event file has to be an unscreened event list with the frame
    extension. The output FITS file can be used later for the XSELECT time
    filtering.

    With the hidden options "segment_[abcd]", users can choose CCD segments to
    monitor the telemetry saturation. If one of the segments chosen had
    telemetry saturation, that time interval is excluded from the GTI list.

    The task assumes that there is more than one event in a CCD frame in a
    8 sec frame exposure. If there is no event in a frame (though it rarely
    happens), the task excludes the exposure interval from the GTI list.

    Since xisgtigen version 2012-04-22, a hidden parameter 'wingti' is added
    (default "no") in order to maximize GTI for the window option or the
    psum mode. With wingti=yes, telemetry saturation is judged for each
    exposure of window (or each line in the psum mode). This is particularly
    useful for bright sources, which often suffer from pileup and telemetry
    saturation. See the web page:

      <Recipe for Pileup Effect on the Suzaku XIS>
    for details.
