NAME
    xiscoord -- calculate the ACT, DEC, FOC and sky X/Y coordinates
                of the XIS events

USAGE
    xiscoord  infile outfile attitude pointing

DESCRIPTION

    The task calculates the ACT, DEC, FOC and sky X/Y coordinates of each
    event in the input XIS event file and output an event file with those
    columns filled.

    The ACT, DEC and FOC coordinates describe event positions in an individual
    detector or positions co-aligned between detectors. The task reads those
    information from the telemetry definition (teldef) file specified in the
    hidden option "teldef", and which are generally stored in the CALDB.
    The sky X/Y coordinate describes event arrival direction with respect to
    the nominal R.A. and Dec. position defined in the FITS header (TCRVL10
    and TCRVL11 for the R.A., Dec. reference positions and TCDLT10 and TCDLT11
    for the X/Y pixel scales). To know the satellite attitude at each event
    arrival time, the task reads an attitude file corresponding to each
    observation specified in the attitude option, or uses an average EULER
    angle with additional ea1, ea2 and ea3 options with the attitude option
    EULER. 

    The pointing option specifies the type of the reference position to be
    referred for the nominal R.A. and Dec. position. With the "KEY" parameter,
    the task read the the RA_NOM and DEC_NOM keywords in the input event file,
    while the "USER" can give the user-defined nominal R.A., Dec. position
    with putting the additional ref_alpha and ref_delta options.

PARAMETERS

infile [filename]
    Input event FITS file. 

outfile [filename]
    output event FITS file.

(ignore_frames = yes) [boolean]
    Flag to ignore the FRAMES extension

attitude [filename]
    Attitude file name, or EULER. When EULER is specified, fixed Euler 
    angles are used for the attitude of the satellite.

ea1 [real]
    1st XYZ-Euler angle (deg), asked when attitude=EULER.

ea2 [real]
    2nd XYZ-Euler angle (deg), asked when attitude=EULER.

ea3 [real]
    3rd XYZ-Euler angle (deg), asked when attitude=EULER.

pointing [string]
    pointing type, KEY/USER. When KEY is specified, the RA_NOM and
    DEC_NOM keywords in the input event file are referred to as the sky
    reference position. When USER is specified, a user can set
    the RA, DEC and ROLL of the sky references, manually.

ref_alpha [real]
    R.A. of the sky reference position, asked when pointing=USER.

ref_delta [real]
    DEC. of the sky reference position, asked when pointing=USER.

ref_roll = 0.0 [real]
    Roll angle of the sky reference, asked when pointing=USER.

(teldef = CALDB) [filename]
    Input teldef file. The file is generally stored in CALDB, named
    ae_xiN_teldef_YYYYMMDD.fits where the string YYYYMMDD is the release date.

(aberration = yes) [boolean]
    correct aberration.

(rand_seed = 7) [integer]
    random number seed

(rand_skip = 0.0) [real]
    random number skip count

(hk_time_margin = 3600) [real]
    time margin in second to consider AE-temp is valid

(hk_aetemp_min = -30) [real]
    minimum value in degC to consider AE-temp is valid

(hk_aetemp_max = +40) [real]
    maximum value in degC to consider AE-temp is valid

(num_event = -1) [integer]
    number of event (-1: all, 0: exit)

(event_freq = 1000) [integer]
    Event number printout frequency

(anl_verbose = -1) [integer]
    ANL verbose level (-1: full, 0: minimum)

(anl_profile = yes) [boolean]
    Enable ANL module profiling

(chatter = 2) [integer]
    message chatter level (0: min, 2: norm, 5: max)

EXAMPLES

1.  Calculate the detector and sky coordinates for the event file
    ae_x_all19990902_2325_2625_xis0_5x5.fff, and create a new event file
    ae_x_all19990902_2325_2625_xis0_5x5.unf by referring to
    ae_all19990902_2325_2625.att, with sky reference position taken from
    the keywords RA_NOM, DEC_NOM.

    % xiscoord infile=ae_x_all19990902_2325_2625_xis0_5x5.fff \
	       outfile=ae_x_all19990902_2325_2625_xis0_5x5.unf	\
	       attitude=ae_all19990902_2325_2625.att pointing=KEY 

2.  Calculate the detector and sky coordinates for the event file
    ae_x_all19990902_2325_2625_xis0_5x5.fff, and create a new event file
    ae_x_all19990902_2325_2625_xis0_5x5.unf, for the the average satellite
    Euler angles (187.25,88.0,70.0) and the sky reference point (187.25, 2.0)
    with the roll angle of the sky reference 0.0.
