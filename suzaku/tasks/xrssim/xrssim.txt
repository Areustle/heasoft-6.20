NAME
    xrssim -- Suzaku XRT+XRS simulator


USAGE
    xrssim (see EXAMPLES)

    
DESCRIPTION

This task simulates the XRT+XRS detector on board the Suzaku
satellite. This program (1) reads a photon list generated by the
photon-list generator 'mkphlist', (2) simulates the process of
the XRT and the XRS, and (3) outputs an XRS event FITS file. 
The output event file may be analyzed just like real data
using standard analysis tools like xselect.

The hidden parameters are optimized so that the output events simulate
the actual XRT+XRS data best.  Users are recommended NOT to change any
hidden parameters, unless testing non-standard instrumental
environments.


DESCRIPTION OF THE XRT SIMULATOR

The XRT simulator is based on the ray-tracing program originally coded
by Richard Fink ('xrrt' version 2.0, 1998), which has been updated by
the Suzaku XRT team (version 6.2, 2005). The ray-tracing requires
several FITS input files:

  mirror geometry file (e.g. 'ae_xrt0_mirror_20050505.fits'),
  reflectivity table file (e.g. 'ae_xrta_reflect_20050808.fits'),
  precollimator geometry file (e.g. 'ae_xrts_pcol_20050505.fits'),
  precollimator reflectivity file (e.g. 'ae_xrta_reflect_20050808.fits'),
  backside scatter profile file (e.g. 'ae_xrta_backprof_20050614.fits')

The first file defines geometry of the thin-foil mirror (such as the
foil configuration and the obstruction by the alignment bars and
sector masks), and the second file contains X-ray reflectivity data
for a single foil as a function of surface energy and incident
angle. The reflectivity-table file is created by the 'xrrtrt' ftool
using the 'atomfile' and ' henkefile' which define basic atomic
parameters and scattering parameters respectively.

Instead of using the precalculated reflectivity table file, the foil
reflectivity may be calculated on the fly from 'atomfile' and '
henkefile' by forcing 'atomcaldb=yes'; this option is not recommended
for standard use though.

The thermal shield transmission is taken into account as a default 
(considerthermalshield = yes).


DESCRIPTION OF THE XRS SIMULATOR

The current XRS simulator is simplified, such that it performs a
photon-to-event simulation according to the probability distribution
given by the input RMF file.  Actual physical processes taking place
within the XRS detector are not simulated.  It is assumed that the
instrumental efficiency, as well as the pulse height distribution, is
included in the RMF file.

For each incident photon energy, the simulator judges whether the
photon is detected or not by generating a random number according to
the detection efficiency given by the RMF, and, if detected, the
output pulse height is determined according to the pulse height
distribution in the RMF.

The satellite aspect is specified by the Z-Y-Z Euler angles (ea_phi,
ea_theta, ea_psi).  The XRS PIXEL number (0-31) is output when the
ray-traced photon falls one of the 32 XRS pixels.  Actual positions of
the photons on the focal plane, as well as the RA and DEC of the
detected events, are also output in the event file.  Optionally,
events outside of the XRS pixels may be discarded
(xrs_pixel_select=no).

The XRS filter-wheel transmission may be included optionally
('xrs_filter' parameter).


ALIGNMENTS

Alignment parameters between the detectors are defined in the 'teldef
file' (such as 'ae_xrs_teldef_20050622.fits').  At present,
no misalignment is taken into account; namely, the XRT is pointing the
satellite Z-axis direction, and the optical axis is at the center of
the XRS sensor.

ref_alpha [real]
    R.A. of the sky reference position.

ref_delta [real]
    DEC. of the sky reference position.

ref_roll [real]
    Roll angle of the sky reference.
    The "ref_alpha", "ref_delta", "ref_roll" parameters specify the sky
    reference, which determines the reference (RA, DEC) and roll angle ROLL
    of the SKY coordinates (X, Y).  These parameters are only asked when
    "pointing=USER". When "pointing=AUTO", the sky reference (RA, DEC) is
    read from the attitude file header keywords RA_NOM, RA_DEC, specified by
    the "attitude" parameter unless "attitude=NONE", and ROLL is set to 0.0.
    When "pointing=AUTO" and "attitude=filename", they are calculated from the
    default Euler angles, specified by the "ea1", "ea2", and "ea3" parameters,
    as RA=ea1, DEC=90-ea2, ROLL=0.0.

infile[1-8] [file name]
    The name of the input photon-list file generated by 'mkphlist'.
    Up to 8 files can be specified at the same time.

(gtifile = none) [file name]
    GTI file for TIME offset.
    The PHOTON_TIME column in the photon file usually starts from 0.0 s
    unless otherwise specified, and it is treated as the time offset relative
    to the GTI. When the "exposure" is longer than the specified GTI or
    "nphoton" is large enough to exceed incident photons during the GTI 
    (i.e. photon flux * the GTI duration), the GTI wrap-around occurs,
    namely, TIME starts again from the beginning of the GTI.

(date_obs = "2000-01-01T00:00:00") [string]
    Observation start date, only used when gtifile="none".

(date_end = "2000-01-01T00:00:00") [string]
    Observation end date, only used when gtifile="none".
    When date_obs = date_end, the original TIME column value in photon FITS
    file is used.

(attitude = none) [file name]
    Attitude file name to read ZYZ-Euler angles.

ea1 [real]
    Default 1st Euler Angle (degree).

ea2 [real]
    Default 2nd Euler Angle (degree).

ea3 [real]
    Default 3rd Euler Angle (degree).
    The "ea1", "ea2", "ea3" parameters are asked even if you specify an
    attitude file at the "attitude" parameter and used when the input attitude
    file does not have data on simulating time frames (GTI) specified by the
    "gtifile" parameter. These parameters are also used to calculate the
    sky reference (ref_alpha, ref_delta, ref_roll), when "pointing=AUTO"
    and "attitude=NONE".

    FITS binary extension name (EXTNAME keyword) in the "xrtfile" for the
    mirror description FITS table.
