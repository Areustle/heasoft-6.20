NAME
    aemkehk -- create an extended HK file from orbit and attitude files

USAGE

DESCRIPTION

    Create an extended HK file for Suzaku,reading satellite
    attitude and orbit files.
    The output .ehk file has the following columns.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Step of the TIME column is copied from a reference file,
    or specified by a user with start, stop and step time.
    The orbit file must cover the entire time range with abount
    +/- one day margin, in order to calculate T_SAA, TN_SAA, etc.


PARAMETERS

outfile [filename]
    Output .ehk file name.

orbit [filename]
    Input orbit file

attitude [filename]
    Input attitude file

reference [filename]
    Time reference file, or 'NONE' to specify start, stop and step time

(teldef = CALDB) [filename]
    Location of telescope definition file

(leapfile = CALDB;$ENV{LHEA_DATA}/leapsec.fits) [file name]
    Name of the leap second file. The default value is set to
    indicate that aemkehk will search for the file in CALDB first
    and then in the LHEA_DATA directory if necessary (the actual path
    for the HEADAS installation in use will be shown).

(rigidity = CALDB;$ENV{LHEA_DATA}/rigidity_20060421.fits) [file name]
    Location of the FITS rigidity data file for COR2 column, specified
    similarly to the leap second file.

(time_col_name = TIME) [string]
    Time column name of the time reference file.  Used when reference=filename

start_time [real]
    Start time (when reference=NONE), or 0.0 to get from input attitude file

stop_time [real]
    Stop time (when reference=NONE), or 0.0 to get from input attitude file

step_sec [real] 
    Step time in seconds (when reference=NONE)

margin_sec [real] 
    Margin time before and after the specified in seconds, when reference=NONE

(clobber = yes) [boolean]
    Overwrite output file if exists?

(anl_verbose = 0) [integer]
    ANL verbose level (-1:full, 0:minimum)

(anl_profile = no) [integer]
    Enable ANL module profiling

(num_event = -1) [integer]
    Number of event (-1=all, 0=exit)

(event_freq = 10000) [integer]
    Event number printout frequency

(chatter = 2) [integer]
    message chatter level (0:min,2:norm,5:max)


EXAMPLES

1    Create an .ehk file of "ae123456789.ehk",
     reading an orbit file of "ae123456789.orb"
     and an attitude file of "ae123456789.att".
     Step of the time column is copied from "reference.hk".

    % aemkehk output=ae123456789.ehk orbit=ae123456789.orb \ 
       attitude=ae123456789.att reference=reference.hk


2    Create an .ehk file of "ae123456789.ehk",
    reading an orbit file of "ae123456789.orb".
    and an attitude file of "ae123456789.att".
    Start and stop time are get from attitude file "ae123456789.att",
    and the step is specified as 1.0 seconds.

    % aemkehk output=ae123456789.ehk orbit=ae123456789.orb \
    attitude=ae123456789.att reference=none start_time=0 \
    end_time=0 step_sec=1.margin_sec=0
