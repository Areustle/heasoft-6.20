NAME

	hxdgtigen -- Make GTI file not to satulate telemetry


USAGE

	hxdgtigen hk_dir hk_file WPU gti_fname


DESCRIPTION

	The tool makes GTI file to reject periods when the telemetry is 
	satulated, by accessing an HXD HK file. The information of
	saturation is picked up from 'HXD_WnTLMBFSH', 'HXD_WnEVTLMRJCT'
	and 'HXD_WEVTn_BREC_CNT' in HXD_SYS extension of the HXD HK file,
	where 'n' implies WPU analog board ID (0,1,2,3). The time
        during the transfer saturation (FIFO-full) between the analog
        and digital electronics (AE and DE) can be additionally excluded
         from the GTI with "fifo_full" option (default = no).


PARAMETERS

hk_dir
	directory where HXD HK file exists

hk_file
	file name of the HXD HK file

WPU
	WPU board ID to be accessed (0123 is all the boards and default)

gti_fname
	GTI file name for output

(fifo_full = yes)
        Additionally exclude FIFO-full time between AE-DE or not.

(clobber = no)
	Overwrite existing output file or not.

(chatter = 2)
	message chatter level (0:min, 2:norm, 5:max)


EXAMPLES

	To get GTI when telemetry is not satulated during the observation
	described in HXD HK fits named "ae100006010hxd_0.hk" in "./hk" 
	directory with accessing all of the four WPU board (0123),

	% hxdgtigen hk_dir="./hk" hk_file="ae100006010hxd_0.hk" \
		    WPU="0123" gti_fname="ae100006010hxd_0_tlm.gti"

	then, you get GTI file named "ae100006010hxd_0_tlm.gti".

	Instead, if you exclude the WPU1 information and use only WPU023,
	please specify WPU="023",

	% hxdgtigen hk_dir="./hk" hk_file="ae100006010hxd_0.hk" \
		    WPU="023" gti_fname="ae100006010hxd_0_tlm.gti"

       To exclude the FIFO-full time between AE and DE additionally,
        use the "fifo_full" option with "yes".

       % hxdgtigen  hk_dir="./hk" hk_file="ae100006010hxd_0.hk" \
		    WPU="0123" gti_fname="ae100006010hxd_0_tlm.gti" \
                    fifo_full="yes"
