NAME
    xisucode -- Fill microcode information in the FITS header

USAGE
    xisucode microcode_file infile1 [infile2 ...]

DESCRIPTION

The task obtains information of XIS minor modes for the input 1st FITS
files (FFFs) from a microcode list file in CALDB, and writes important 
parameters for calibration (WINOPT, WIN_ST, WIN_SIZ, SNAPTIME, PSUM_L, 
CI, BINNING, SRAV_VER and DELAY) in the header keywords of the input 
FFFs. The task also put a correct TIMEDEL keyword value for the WINDOW 
and BURST modes.

The task reads the CODE_ID keyword in the input 1st FITS file, and
finds information of the microcode with the same ID in the microcode
list. When data are taken with the charge injection option (CI = 2 
for SCI-54rows or 3 for SCI-108rows), the keywords SCIPERIY, SCISTATY,
SCISPEED, SCIN, SCIYn, AP4N, AP4Yn, AP256N, and AP256Yn are also
filled.
