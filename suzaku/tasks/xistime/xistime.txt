NAME
    xistime -- assign time to data in Normal, Burst and Window option

USAGE
    xistime   infile outfile timfile
 
DESCRIPTION

   'xistime' assigns the corrected arrival time to the XIS events, and
    performs the fine time measurement for the Burst mode and Window
    option.

    The corrected arrival time for each XIS event is calculated using the
    .tim file which contains the time calibration for the observation.
    The .tim file is distributed with the observation (see "ae<obsid>.tim").
    The task also assigns the finer time resolution to data taken with
    Burst or Window mode (example : data taken with 1/4 of window has a 2
    sec time resolution). The task assumes that X-ray events arrive in the
    middle of the frame exposure in which those X-ray events are detected,
    i.e. "start time of a frame exposure" + "end time of a frame exposure")/2.

    The final time value is written in the TIME columns.
    This task does not correct times for data taken with the P-sum mode.

    XIS submodes with the burst option enabled can have upwards of 98.75%
    dead time per 8 s frame. The approximate adjustment made to the LIVETIME
    and EXPOSURE header keywords with respect to ONTIME without deadtime can
    break down under certain conditions (e.g. making light curve).
    The 'xistime' with the 'bstgti=yes' option accounts fully for the dead
    time instroduced with the burst option to the GTI, although the rows
    in GTI will become large, namely "number of the CCD frames (8 sec) in
    the event file" x "number of windows per frame".


PARAMETERS

infile [filename]
    input event FITS file.

outfile [filename]
    output event FITS file.

(ignore_frames = yes) [boolean]
    Flag to ignore the FRAMES extension.

timfile [filename]
    Input FITS file with timing information. The file named ae<obsid>.tim, can
    be be found in the Suzaku data distribution package of each observation.

(gapsec = 0.1) [real]
    Allowed gap between frames in second.

(bstgti = no) [boolean]
    Generate GTI for the burst option without approximation.

(anl_verbose = -1) [integer]
    ANL verbose level (-1:full, 0:minimum)

(anl_profile = yes) [boolean]
    Enable ANL module profiling

(num_event = -1) [integer]
    number of event (-1:all, 0:exit)

(event_freq = 1000) [integer]
    Event number printout frequency

(chatter = 2) [integer]
    message chatter level (0:min, 2:norm, 5:max)


EXAMPLES

1.  Calculate arrival time 'TIME' for the event file named
    ae20041215_1055_1932_xis0_5x5.fff, and create a new event file
    ae20041215_1055_1932_xis0_5x5.unf.

    % xistime infile=ae20041215_1055_1932_xis0_5x5.fff \
              outfile=ae20041215_1055_1932_xis0_5x5.unf \
              timfile=ae100019030.tim
