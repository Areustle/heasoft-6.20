NAME
    xissim -- Suzaku XRT + XIS simulator

USAGE
    xissim (see EXAMPLES)

DESCRIPTION

    'xissim' simulates the XRT + XIS system on board the Suzaku satellite.
    This program conducts the photon-by-photon simulation as it
    (1) reads a photon list generated by the photon-list generator 'mkphlist',
    (2) simulates the photon processes in the XRT and the XIS,
    (3) outputs an XIS event FITS file.
    The output event file may be analyzed just like real data using
    standard analysis tools such as 'xselect'.

    The 'xissim' also includes the function of 'mkphlist', and can perform
    the photon list generation for simulation by itself, with
    enable_photongen=yes.  Parameters with '(PhotonGen)' in the PARAMETERS
    section below are used for the 'mkphlist' function. See the 'mkphlist'
    help file for a detailed explanation.

    Some hidden parameters are optimized so that the output events simulate
    the actual XRT + XIS data best. Users are recommended NOT to change them,
    unless testing non-standard instrumental environments.

DESCRIPTION OF THE XRT SIMULATOR

    The XRT simulator is based on the ray-tracing program originally coded
    by Richard Fink ('xrrt' version 2.0, 1998), which has been updated by
    the Suzaku XRT team (version 6.4, 2006). The ray-tracing requires several
    FITS input files:

    - mirror geometry file (e.g. "ae_xrt0_mirror_20060710.fits"),
    - reflectivity table file (e.g. "ae_xrta_reflect_20060710.fits"),
    - backside scatter profile file (e.g. "ae_xrta_backprof_20060719.fits")
    - thermal shield transmission file (e.g. "ae_xrta_shield_20051129.fits")

    The first file defines geometry of the thin-foil mirror (such as the
    foil configuration and the obstruction by the alignment bars and
    sector masks), and the second file contains X-ray reflectivity data
    for a single foil as a function of surface energy and incident angle.
    The reflectivity-table file is created by the 'xrrtrt' ftool using the
    "atomfile" and "henkefile", which define basic atomic parameters and
    scattering parameters respectively.

    Instead of using the precalculated reflectivity table file, the foil
    reflectivity may be calculated on the fly from "atomfile" and "henkefile"
    by forcing "atomcaldb=yes" though this option is not recommended for a
    standard use.

DESCRIPTION OF THE XIS SIMULATOR

    The current XIS simulator is simplified, such that it performs a
    photon-to-event simulation according to the probability distribution
    given by an input RMF file. Actual physical processes taking place
    within the XIS detector are NOT simulated.  It is assumed that the
    instrumental efficiency, as well as the pulse height distribution,
    is included in the RMF file.

    For each incident photon energy, the simulator judges whether the
    photon is detected or not by generating a random number according to
    the detection efficiency given by the RMF, and, if detected, the
    output pulse height is determined according to the pulse height
    distribution in the RMF.

    The satellite aspect is specified by the set of Z-Y-Z Euler angles
    (ea1, ea2, ea3).  Actual positions of the photons on the focal plane,
    as well as the RA and DEC of the detected events, are also output
    in the event file.  By default, events outside of the XIS CCD chips
    are discarded (xis_chip_select=yes).

    The output FITS file contains event and GTI extensions.  The current
    version of 'xissim' does not consider non X-ray background, event
    pile-up, event grade, nor CCD exposure frames.  Though the output
    event files contains all the columns in the FITS files of the real
    data, the GRADE column is filled with 0, while the PHA column has
    the same value as the PI column.  The output FITS file also contain
    the information of the faked photons.  Make sure that you set up
    correct calibration files, or 'xissim' perhaps outputs a wrong result
    without any warning.

    The 'xissim' version 2007-05-28 or later fills the STATUS column
    appropriately as the 'xisputpixelquality' ftool does, which had been
    filled with 0 before. To do this, two calibration files of

    - CCD bad pixel file (e.g. "ae_xi0_badcolum_20070418.fits")
    - 55Fe calibration source area file (e.g. "ae_xi0_calmask_20060731.fits")

    must be specified by "badcolumfile" and "calmaskfile" parameters.
    The observation mode is read from header keywords in the primary
    extension of "phafile", e.g. WINOPT, WIN_ST, WIN_SIZ, CI, SCIN, SCIYn.
    When "phafile=none", which is the default, WINOPT=0, WIN_ST=0,
    WIN_SIZ=1024, and CI=0, i.e. window off and SCI off, are assumed.
    This feature can be turned off by setting "enable_pixq=no" for backward
    compatibility.

ALIGNMENTS

    Alignment parameters between the detectors are defined in the "teldef"
    file (such as "ae_xi0_teldef_20050922.fits").  With the "teldef" file,
    "ae_xi0_teldef_20050922.fits", no misalignment is taken into account;
    namely, the XRT is pointing the satellite Z-axis direction, and the
    optical axis is at the center of the XIS sensor. With newer teldef file,
    "ae_xi0_teldef_20051009.fits" or later, in orbit alignment measurements
    between sensors are considered.

ref_alpha [real]
    R.A. of the sky reference position.

ref_delta [real]
    DEC. of the sky reference position.

ref_roll [real]
    Roll angle of the sky reference.
    The "ref_alpha", "ref_delta", "ref_roll" parameters specify the sky
    reference, which determines the reference (RA, DEC) and roll angle ROLL
    of the SKY coordinates (X, Y).  These parameters are only asked when
    "pointing=USER". When "pointing=AUTO", the sky reference (RA, DEC) is
    read from the attitude file header keywords RA_NOM, RA_DEC, specified by
    the "attitude" parameter unless "attitude=NONE", and ROLL is set to 0.0.
    When "pointing=AUTO" and "attitude=filename", they are calculated from the
    default Euler angles, specified by the "ea1", "ea2", and "ea3" parameters,
    as RA=ea1, DEC=90-ea2, ROLL=0.0.

infile[1-8] [file name]
    The name of the input photon-list file generated by 'mkphlist'.
    Up to 8 files can be specified at the same time.

(gtifile = none) [file name]
    GTI file for TIME offset.
    The PHOTON_TIME column in the photon file usually starts from 0.0 s
    unless otherwise specified, and it is treated as the time offset relative
    to the GTI. When the "exposure" is longer than the specified GTI or
    "nphoton" is large enough to exceed incident photons during the GTI 
    (i.e. photon flux * the GTI duration), the GTI wrap-around occurs,
    namely, TIME starts again from the beginning of the GTI.

(date_obs = "2000-01-01T00:00:00") [string]
    Observation start date, only used when gtifile="none".

(date_end = "2000-01-01T00:00:00") [string]
    Observation end date, only used when gtifile="none".
    When date_obs = date_end, the original TIME column value in photon FITS
    file is used.

    Attitude file name to read ZYZ-Euler angles.

ea1 [real]
    Default 1st Euler Angle (degree).

ea2 [real]
    Default 2nd Euler Angle (degree).

ea3 [real]
    Default 3rd Euler Angle (degree).
    The "ea1", "ea2", "ea3" parameters are asked even if you specify an
    attitude file at the "attitude" parameter and used when the input attitude
    file does not have data on simulating time frames (GTI) specified by the
    "gtifile" parameter. These parameters are also used to calculate the
    sky reference (ref_alpha, ref_delta, ref_roll), when "pointing=AUTO"
    and "attitude=NONE".
