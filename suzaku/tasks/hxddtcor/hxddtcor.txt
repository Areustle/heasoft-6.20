NAME
	hxddtcor -- dead time correction tool for HXD pha file(s)

USAGE
	hxddtcor event_fname pi_fname

DESCRIPTION
	HXD data usually suffer about 4-5% dead time (95-6 % live time).
	This tool corrects 'EXPOSURE' in spectrum FITS file(s) by considering
	the dead time with a method using the "pseudo" trigger events in the 
	HXD data. It screens the input event files containing pseudo-events 
	(such as the uff files), and selects cleaned pseudo events using the 
	gti parameters attached to the pi files. Total number of the pseudo 
	events thus obtained directly represents the live time.

PARAMETERS
event_fname
	HXD event fits file name for input. The file must cover the WHOLE
	observation period utilized in the pi-file generation, and must also
	include	pseudo type events; i.e., 
		unscreened event file (event_uf/aeXXXXXhxd_0_wel_uf.evt)
        or	pseudo event file (see below). 
	To input multiple files, (c.f. in case you have	several unscreened 
	event files, event_uf/aeXXXXXhxd_[1,2,3...]_wel_uf.evt ), a file 
	containing the list of event files should be prepared (Filelist), 
	and input it as '@Filelist'. Also see 'EXAMPLES'.

pi_fname
	PHA spectrum fits file to correct the EXPOSURE. To input multiple files
	a file containing the list of files is  needed (Filelist), and the
	Filelist is input in the program as '@Filelist'.

(save_pseudo = no)
	Option for a skilled person: Pseudo-event file can be saved,
	which is extracted from the input event fits files (named by the 
	'event_fname'). The pseudo file saved here contains all pseudo events,
	i.e. the list is different from the pseudo file screened via DET_TYPE=2
	criteria. As it is significantly smaller than the original uff file, 
	you can save your time by inputing it in place of the uff event file, 
	when you next need to apply the dead time correction.

(chatter = 2)	
	Chatter level (0:min, 2:norm, 5:max)


EXAMPLES

1.	To correct dead time of PHA fits file, "ae100006010hxd_pin.pi", with
	unscreened event fits file "ae100006010hxd_0_wel_uf.evt", as follows,

	% hxddtcor event_fname="ae100006010hxd_0_wel_uf.evt" \
		   pi_fname="ae100006010hxd_pin.pi"

		   
2.	If you have three PHA files to correct, "ae100006010hxd_pin0.pi",
	"ae100006010hxd_pin1.pi", and "ae100006010hxd_pin2.pi", in silent,
	then,

	% cat pi.list
	  ae100006010hxd_pin0.pi
	  ae100006010hxd_pin1.pi
	  ae100006010hxd_pin2.pi
	% hxddtcor event_fname="ae100006010hxd_0_wel_uf.evt" \
		   pi_fname="@pi.list" chatter=0


3.	If you have two or more unscreened event files, named
	"ae100006010hxd_1_wel_uf.evt" and "ae100006010hxd_2_wel_uf.evt",
	please list these files in a file, for example, "uf.list", then,

	% cat uf.list
	  ae100006010hxd_1_wel_uf.evt
	  ae100006010hxd_2_wel_uf.evt
	% hxddtcor event_fname="@uf.list" \
		   pi_fname="ae100006010hxd_pin.pi"
