	ANL, Version 1.81

		Install Notes

This document describes how to build and install ANL package.

0. Install FTOOLS, CERN libraries, etc.

  You must install following packages before building ANL:

	o cfitsio
		http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/
	o cfortran.h
		attached with cfitsio
	o CERN libraries (includes hbook.h)
		http://cern.ch/cernlib/
	  or dummy library available at
		http://www-x.phys.metro-u.ac.jp/~ishisaki/adsoft-archive/
	o atFunctions
		http://www-x.phys.metro-u.ac.jp/~ishisaki/adsoft-archive/
	o COM + CLI [+ readline]
		http://www-x.phys.metro-u.ac.jp/~ishisaki/adsoft-archive/
	o astetool
		http://www-x.phys.metro-u.ac.jp/~ishisaki/adsoft-archive/
	o ascatool
		http://www-x.phys.metro-u.ac.jp/~ishisaki/adsoft-archive/

  Actually, FITSIO is only required to build sample programs in the "sample"
  directory. And ascatool is not required at all, but only setting library
  paths in the "Includes.make" file for backward compatibility.

1. Edit "Imakefile.def" to fit your system. 

  "Imakefile.def" is included by "Imakefile"s of ANL.
  Read comment lines carefully and set keywords properly.

2. Make ANL package

  Type as follows.

	% xmkmf -a
	% make

3. Install ANL package

  Create install directories where you wrote in "Imakefile.def"
  (ANL_INC, ANL_LIB, ANL_BIN), and type 'make install'.

  After installing ANL package, you can erase object files
  and libraries by typing 'make clean'.
  
4. Install test

  You are recommended to check your installation of ANL.
  Type as follows:

	% cd sample
	% xmkmf -a
	% make
	% make test

  If something is wrong, 'make' or 'make test' complains error messages.
  Read those messages and check "Imakefile.def" again.

  You can also test obsolete "Makefile"s using "Makefile.tmpl" by typing
  'make obsolete' in "./sample/" directory.

  After test, you shuld clean sample directories for ANL users,
  typing 'make clean' in "./sample/" directory.
