<h2>NAME</h2>

barycorr  -- Generalized multi-mission barycenter correction tool

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>barycorr infile=&lt;filename&gt; outfile=&lt;filename&gt; orbitfiles=&lt;filename&gt;</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
barycorr is a multi-mission tool for applying barycenter corrections
to X-ray timing data.  The tool is designed to apply to data from
RXTE, Swift, Chandra/AXAF, and NuSTAR.  barycorr recognizes
time-related columns and keywords within X-ray FITS files, and
corrects these time values to the equivalent time at the solar system
barycenter (SSB), expressed in TDB.  barycorr applies geometric
light-time calculations, relativistic corrections, and mission
specific clock offset corrections.  If a photon arrived at the given
observatory timestamp, barycorr calculates the time that the same
photon would have arrived at the solar system barycenter from the
target.  

<p>
barycorr uses the observatory orbit ephemeris file orbitFile,
target position (ra, dec), and refFrame "FK5" (DE200) or "ICRS"
(DE405).  When RA and Dec are not provided, an effort is made to
retrieve the target information from the FITS file.

<p>
barycorr recognizes the mission-specific components of a FITS input
file according by reading the MISSION keyword.  The special MISSION,
'Geocenter' corresponds to time stamps at the geocenter.

<p>
barycorr is a Perl wrapper to a standalone utility program (hdaxbary)
which is an extended version of the CIAO function "axbary",
a multi-mission function that applies barycenter corrections to
HFWG-compliant FITS files.  

<p>
The "barytime = no" option (default) will replace the values in the original
TIME (case-insensitive) column from the input file with the
barycenter-corrected times and update all time-related keywords and GTI
values appropriately. Use of this option on binned (ie, XTE science array)
data files is discouraged as it will preclude subsequent application of
tools that expect evenly spaced time intervals to the modified datafile.
<p>
The "barytime = yes" option will simply append a new column, "BARYTIME", to
a copy of the original file. No changes will be made to the time-related
keywords or GTI table(s) in this case.
<p>
<pre>
Do not ever use DE405 on a FITS file that has:
    TIMESYS="TDB"
  but not:
    RADECSYS="ICRS" or PLEPHEM="JPL-DE405"

TIMESYS="TDB" _with_    RADECSYS="ICRS" and/or PLEPHEM="JPL-DE405"
                           should use denum=405.
TIMESYS="TDB" _without_ RADECSYS="ICRS" or     PLEPHEM="JPL-DE405"
                           should use denum=200.
</pre>
<p>
DE405 may be used in conjunction with FK5 spacecraft orbit ephemeris.
The maximum error is 2 ns for each earth radius that the spacecraft is
removed from the geocenter.  All positions provided by Tempo are on the
DE200 reference frame, however - closer to FK5.  This could introduce
errors of up to 0.02 ms.  A function, c200to405, is provided to convert
DE200 positions to ICRS.  Even so, it is recommended that DE200 is used
for Tempo solutions that are based on DE200; apparently, efforts are
underway to make Tempo support DE405.
</dl>


<p>
<b>Swift:</b> The barycorr tool will attempt to apply the measured
clock offset to all times based on the clock file.  If
clockfile=CALDB, then CALDB will be queried for this information. (The
user must keep CALDB up to date for this to function properly.)  If
the swco.dat file does not cover the times in question then the tool
will apply a correction based on the value of the UTCFINIT keyword
plus an estimated clock-drift term. In this case a warning message
will be generated and the TIERABSO value will be set to indicate the
lower precision of this correction compared to using the measured
clock offset.

<p>
<b>RXTE:</b> The barycorr tool attempts to apply a RXTE clock offset
correction, which is normally stored in the file named
$LHEA_DATA/tdc.dat.  The RXTE mission is now complete and no further
clock offset corrections are expected.

<p>
<b>NuSTAR:</b> The barycorr tool attempts to apply a NuSTAR clock
offset correction, if the clockfile parameter is supplied.  If the
parameter is not supplied (clockfile='NONE'), then the user can expect
accuracies of the magnitude +/- 100 msec.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>infile [filename]
<dd>Input FITS filename. All extentions with TIMESYS and TSTART will be corrected.
<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]
<dd>Output FITS filename. If barytime=no (default), a copy of the input file with the Time column overwritten and
all time-related keywords modified appropriately. If barytime=yes, a copy of the input file with no changes
other than a BARYTIME column appended.
<p>

<dt>orbitfiles [filename]
<dd> File(s) containing orbit ephemeris information. If a list of orbit files is input (or specified via the @filename convention) any files outside the time range of the input file will be ignored and any gaps (beyond the specified tolerance) in orbit file coverage within the time range of the input file will result in an error. 
<p>

<dt>(clockfile = CALDB) [string]
<dd><b>SWIFT and NuSTAR ONLY:</b>Provide the name of the clock correction file.
This should either be the name of a file, "CALDB", or "NONE".  
If the parameter is "CALDB", then the task will automatically retrieve the
clock file from the Calibration Database.  The Swift ascii version of the
file ($LHEA_DATA/swco.dat) can also be used if the CALDB is unavailable.
A value of "NONE" means no clock correction (NuSTAR only).
<b>RXTE and Chandra:</b>This parameter is ignored.
<p>

<dt>(ra = -) [string]
<dd>Right Ascension. If not provided the routine will search the input file for RA, RA_OBJ, RA_PNT, or RA_NOM. Must be
expressed in decimal degrees.
<p>

<dt>(dec = -) [string]
<dd>Declination. If not provided the routine will search the input file for DEC, DEC_OBJ, DEC_PNT, or DEC_NOM. Must be
expressed in decimal degrees.
<p>

<dt>(refframe = FK5) [string]
<dd>Coordinate reference frame. Allowed values are "FK5" (default; DE200) or "ICRS" (DE405)
<p>

<dt>(barytime = no)  [boolean]
<dd>If yes, a separate BARYTIME column will be written in the output file?  Otherwise the routine will
overwrite the TIME column with corrected times and all time-related keywords will be updated.
<p>

<dt>(tolerance = 3.0) [real]
<dd>Tolerance (in seconds) for orbit file 'glitches'. Ignored for Swift.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 3) [enumerated integer]
<dd>Standard HEAdas chatter parameter (1-5) controlling the verbosity of the task.
<p>

<dt>(clobber = no) [boolean]
<dd>Standard HEAdas clobber parameter; controls whether an existing output file may be overwritten.
<p>

<dt>(history = yes) [boolean]
<dd>Standard HEAdas history parameter; controls whether the runtime parameter values should be written in block of HISTORY keywords in the output file.
<p>
