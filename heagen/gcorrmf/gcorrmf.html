<h2>NAME</h2>

gcorrmf - Remaps a detector redistribution matrix in channel or energy
    space.

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>gcorrmf infile ebdfile shftfile eshftfile outfilel chatter clobber</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This task remaps a detector redistribution matrix in channel or energy
space. IT SHOULD ONLY BE USED IF ONE KNOWS WHAT ONE IS DOING, or AS
INSTRUCTED by the relevant guest investigator facility. The incorrect
use of this task, or without understanding the implications will
result in erroneous results during subsequent spectral analysis.
<P>    
A detector redistribution matrix (aka detector response matrix)
basically consists of a 2-dimensional array (detector channel vs
incident photon energy) giving the probability that an incident photon
of a given energy will be detected in a given detector channel. For
the following discussion it is useful to think of the matrix as a
column of values (probability for various incident photon energies)
for each detector channel.
<P>    
Given an OGIP-approved FITS format input file, this task provides the
facility to move the columns of the array to the left or right (ie
down or up in channel-space) and the rows of the arrays up and down
(ie up or down in energy-space). It is difficult to generalise, but such a
facility may be useful for converting a detector redistribution matrix
constructed for a given (standard) gain of a detector to the gain
actually applicable to an observation.Again, if you have no idea what
we're talking about here, and have not been explicitly instructed to
use this task, then we strongly recommend you seek further advice.
<P>    
<h3>Channel Shifting</h3>
<P>
The shift to  be  applied  to  each  channel  of  the  i/p  detector
redistribution  matrix  must  be specified by an ASCII i/p file. The
format of each row of this i/p ASCII file must be<br>
<center>MINCHAN MAXCHAN SHIFT FACTOR</center><br> 
denoting all 'columns' of the i/p detector redistribution matrix
between detector channels MINCHAN and MAXCHAN (inclusive) are to be
shifted by an additive SHIFT and multiplicative FACTOR. SHIFT and
FACTOR can be any REAL value, thereby supporting positive, negative,
and fractional channel shifts. If the first line of the file starts
with "! " followed by an energy unit then SHIFT will be assumed to be 
those energy units and shifting
will be calculated using the EBOUNDS extension. Any channel ranges
"implied" by their exclusion from the ASCII file will be shifted by
zero channels.  Note that should the shift applied to two or more
'columns' result in those columns being in the same o/p detector
channel, then their respective probabilities (that an incident photon
of a given energy will be detected in that detector channel) WILL BE
SUMMED.  Similarly, should the applied shifts result in an o/p
detector channel 'column' NOT being populated, then the probability
(that an incident photon of a given energy will be detected in that
detector channel) will be set to zero.  However, shifts below the
minimum, and above the maximum legal channel number for the instrument
will result in those probabilities being excluded.
<P>
    
<h3>Energy Shifting</h3>
<P>
The shift to  be  applied  to  each  energy bin of  the  i/p  detector
redistribution  matrix  must  be specified by an ASCII i/p file. The
format of each row of this i/p ASCII file must be either<br>
<center>MINEBIN MAXEBIN SHIFT</center><br>
or<br>
<center>MINEBIN MAXEBIN SHIFT FACTOR</center><br>
The contents of the energy bin with minimum energy Elow and maximum
energy Ehigh are redistributed over the energy range Elow*FACTOR+SHIFT
to Ehigh*FACTOR+SHIFT. Any energy bins "implied" by their exclusion
from the text file will not be shifted.  Note that should the shift
applied to two or more 'rows' result in those rows being in the same
o/p energy bin, then their respective probabilities (that an incident
photon of a given energy will be detected in a given detector channel)
WILL BE SUMMED.  Similarly, should the applied shifts result in an o/p
energy bin 'row' NOT being populated, then the probability will be set
to zero.  However, shifts below the minimum, and above the maximum
legal energy bin number for the instrument will result in those
probabilities being excluded.
<P>
    
<h2>LIMITATONS ON USE</h2>
    
Users should be aware that, at the current time, this task does NOT
alter the EBOUNDS extension of the i/p detector redistribution matrix.
This may be formally incorrect under certain circumstances, but the
error introduced will not effect spectral analysis using XSPEC, and is
minimal under most circumstances.
<P>    
    
<h2>WARNINGS ON USAGE</h2>
    
This task remaps a detector redistribution matrix in channel and
energy space.  It should only be used if one knows what one is doing,
or as instructed by the relevant guest investigator facility. The use
of this task incorrectly, or without understanding the implications
WILL RESULT IN INCORRECT RESULTS DURING SUBSEQUENT SPECTRAL ANALYSIS.


<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>infile [filename]

<dd>The name of the FITS RMF file to be remapped.
<p>

<dt>ebdfile [filename]

<dd>The name of the FITS EBOUNDS file. This is a hidden parameter
  which defaults to "%", indicating that the EBOUNDS extension is to
  be taked from infile.
<p>

<dt>shftfile [filename]

<dd>The name of a text file giving the channel remapping
  information. Each line should contain 3 or 4 numbers, the first two
  listing the minimum and maximum channels to be remapped, the
  third the additive shift, and the optional fourth the multiplicative factor.
<p>

<dt>eshftfile [filename]

<dd>A hidden parameter for the name of a text file giving the energy 
  remapping information. Each line should contain 3 or 4 numbers, the 
  first two listing the minimum and maximum channels to be remapped, the
  third the additive shift, and the optional fourth the multiplicative factor.
<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>The name of the output RSP file.
<p>

<dt>chatter [integer]

<dd>A hidden parameter giving the output verbosity. At present this
  has no effect.
<p>

<dt>clobber [bool]

<dd>If clobber = yes then overwrite the output files if a file of the
appropriate name already exists.
