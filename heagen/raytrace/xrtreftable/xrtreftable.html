<h2>NAME</h2>

<p>xrtreftable - Calculates the probability of reflection and 
transmission of X-ray photons impinging on a reflecting surface, 
as a function of energy and incident angle. 
Also calculates mass-absorption coefficients of constituents of the 
reflecting foils.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>'xrtreftable' calculates the probability of reflection (or reflectivity) and 
transmission of a photon impinging on a reflecting surface. 
The reflection and transmission depend on the energy of the photon and 
incident angle. The tool obtains information on the composition of the mirror 
surface from an extension called SURFACE in the telescope description file 
(TDF). Both single-layer and multi-layer coatings for the mirrors are supported 
by 'xrtreftable'. The reflection and transmission probabilities are written to 
the first extension of the output file, as a function of energy and incident 
angle. The tool supports more than one group of mirror foils, whereby the 
mirrors in the same group share the same surface coating properties (for 
example, in a real X-ray telescope, mirror groups having different surface 
compositions may be arranged to be located at different radii ranges). 
The tool 'xrtreftable' writes the reflectivity of one mirror group as one 
column, and the corresponding transmission for that group as another column 
with each column containing a two-dimensional array of
probability as a function of energy and incident angle.</p>

<p>In raytracing applications, transmission through the "thick" 
components of mirror foils (as opposed to the "thin" surface) may also 
be required, so 'xrtreftable' calculates mass-absorption coefficients as 
a function of energy and these are stored in extension 2 of the output file, 
one column per "thick material." The thick material properties are also 
specified in the SURFACE extension of the TDF.</p>

<h3>OUTPUT</h3>

<p>The first extension of the output FITS file contains the reflection and 
transmission probabilities as a function of energy and incident angle. 
The first column is a repeat of the energy grid given in the input file. 
There are reflection and transmission columns for each group from the mirror 
surface file. These columns are vectors, with one element per angle. 
Thus, if there are 800 energies and 600 angles, 
then the output extension  have 800 rows, and each reflection 
and transmission column is a vector with 600 elements.</p>

<p>The second extension in the output file holds the mass absorption 
coefficients for the thick-layer components in the telescope. Again, 
the first column is a copy of the energy grid. 
The following columns are the mass absorption coefficients 
(in units of centimeters-squared per gram) for each thick material at that 
energy. Keywords in the header of the extension specify the material and 
density for each column.</p>

  <dt>telescop [string]</dt>
  <dd>Mission name (value of the keyword TELESCOP to write in header keyword for CALDB.)</dd>
  </p>

  <p>
  <dt>instrume [string]</dt>
  <dd>Instrument name (value of the keyword INSTRUME to write in header keyword for CALDB.)</dd>
  </p>

  <p>
  <dt>atomicfile [filename]</dt>
  <dd>Name of the atomic data input file (FITS format with  
binary table extension.) 
  If the extension is not specified in the parameter, 
  the tool opens to the first binary table in the file. 
  The five columns (and units) required are:
     1. Z (Atomic Number), 2. Chemical symbol, 3. Name, 4.Weight (amu), 
     5.Density (grams per cubic centimeter)
  </dd>
If the parameter 'atomicfile' is set to CALDB, 
the file is read from the calibration database.
  </p>

  <p>
  <dt>atmscafile [filename]</dt>
  <dd>Name of the atomic scattering input file (FITS format with  
binary table extension.) This file is used 
  to calculate the optical constants (as a function of energy) of 
  the telescope reflecting mirror surface materials. 
  Different extensions of the file contain different compilations of data 
  in the literature. 
  The extension name can be specified in the extended file name format 
  (name followed by extension name enclosed by []). 
  If the extension is not specified in the parameter, 
  the tool uses the value of the parameter 'atmsctng' as the extension name. 
  This second parameter is also used if atmscafile is set to CALDB. 
  The file contains the real and imaginary components of the atomic 
  scattering form factors as a function of energy in eV. 
  Each extension of the file can contain a different compilation 
  of form factors (the actual extension to be used is specified as 
  part of the input file name string). 
  The energy range of the form factors must cover the energy range 
  for which the user is attempting to make a reflectivity/transmission file. 
  The five columns (and units) required are: 1. Z (Atomic Number), 2.rowindex,
  3. energy (eV), 4. f1real, 5. f2img. 

  </dd>
  Details of the compilations of atomic scattering factors in each 
  extension, as well as references, can be found in the FITS file header. 
  For the SXS+SXT-S and SXI+SXT-I, the name of the extension that should be 
  used is HENKEMODSXT. For HXI1+HXT1 and HXI2+HXT2, the name of the 
  extension that is used should be HenkeSskChantler.

  then by layer. The eight columns (and units) required are:
