This directory contains some tests of flx2xsp.

1. simplest case of a single spectrum.

% flx2xsp input1.txt test1.pha test1.rsp

2. Case of five spectra which are to be written to a type II PHA file. If the output files
   exist they are overwritten.

% flx2xsp input2.txt test2.pha test2.rsp nspec=5 clobber=yes

3. As case 2 except that the input data are in GeV and ergs/cm^2/s.

% flx2xsp input2.txt test3.pha test3.rsp nspec=5 clobber=yes xunit=GeV yunit=ergs/cm^2/s

4. As case 1 except columns are delimited by tabs

% flx2xsp input4.txt test4.pha test4.rsp

5. As case 4 except for a single row in the input file

% flx2xsp input5.txt test5.pha test5.rsp

6. As case 2 except for a single row in the input file

% flx2xsp input6.txt test6.pha test6.rsp nspec=5 clobber=yes

7. Case with discontinuous input energy.

% flx2xsp input7.txt test7.pha test7.rsp

8. Case with energies in reverse order.

% flx2xsp input8.txt test8.pha test8.rsp

9. Case with out-of-order energies to generate error message.

% flx2xsp input9.txt test9.pha test9.rsp
