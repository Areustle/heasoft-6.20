<h2>NAME</h2>

taskname - performs a task on a FITS file 

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>taskname infile[ext][filters] outfile</tt> 

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This task does the following things. 

<!--       This shows how to create a bullet (unordered) list  -->
<ul>
<li>first item

<li>second item
</ul>

<!--       This shows how to create a numbered (ordered) list  -->
<ol>
<li>item 1

<li>item 2
</ol>
<p>
This is the second paragraph of the description.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>infile [filename]

<dd>Input file name and optional extension name or number enclosed in
square brackets (e.g., 'infile.fits[0]' or infile.fits[events]').
Additional filter specifiers can be appended to the file name, also
enclosed in square brackets, as shown in the examples.
<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>Output file name. Precede it with an exclamation point, !, (or \! on
the Unix command line) to overwrite a preexisting file with the same
name (or set the clobber parameter to YES).
<p>

<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If outfile already exists, then "clobber = yes" will overwrite it.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard output.
Setting chatter = 5 will produce detailed diagnostic output, otherwise
this task normally does not write any output.
<p>

<dt>(history = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If history = YES, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written to the
header of the output file to record the current value of all the task
parameters.

</dl>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Note that when commands are issued on the Unix command line, strings
containing special characters such as '[' or ']' must be enclosed in
single or double quotes.
<p>

1. This is the first example which illustrates how to perform
a typical operation.
<p>

<pre>
      taskname 'infile.fits[1]' outfile.fits
</pre>

2. This is the 2nd example which illustrates a more complicated
type of operation.
<p>

<pre>
      taskname 'infile.fits[1]' outfile.fits clobber = YES
               chatter=5 history = YES
</pre>
