<h2>NAME</h2>

ftimgcreate -  Create a FITS primary array image from an ASCII
               template file.

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>ftimgcreate bitpix naxes datafile outfile</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This task  creates a new FITS primary  array  image  from  the  data
values  in  the  input ASCII template file. If the ASCII datafile given
is none/NONE, then the task creates  an  empty  image  file  with
pixel value 0.0.


<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>bitpix = "" [integer]

<dd>
The value for the FITS BITPIX keyword which defines the datatype
of the image.  The following values are allowed:
<pre>
         8 - unsigned (8-bit) byte
         16 - short (16-bit) signed integer
         32 - long (32-bit) signed integer
        -32 - single precision floating point
        -64 - double precision floating point

</pre>

<dt>naxes = "" [character string]
<dd>
List giving the numeric size of each axis in the image.  The numbers
should be separated by commas with no white space.  For the special
case of naxes="none", a null image (NAXIS=0) is created.

<dt>datafile = "" [file name]
<dd>
The   name     of    the   input   ASCII   formatted  data  file
containing the list of pixel values for the  image.   Each  line
of  the  file  may  be  up  to  30000  characters  in length and
contains less than 3000 pixel values.  This task  will  continue
reading  through  the  data  file until it has read the required
number of pixel values, as determined  by  the  product  of  the
axis  sizes.   The data format of the pixel values does not need
to match the data format implied by  BITPIX  since  the  formats
will automatically be converted if necessary.

Case  when  datafile=none,  the  task creates an image file with
pixel values=0.0. When datafile=-, the data is read from stdin.

Note that FITS images follow the convention  of  fortran  arrays
where  pixels  are stored such that the first array index varies
most rapidly.  For example, for a 2 dimensional N x M array, the
pixels  are stored in order of  (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), ..., (N,1),
(1,2), (2,2), ..., (N,2), ..., (N,M).

In the case of integer datatypes (BITPIX = 8,  16,  or  32)  one
may  choose  any  legal integer value (i.e., within the range of
the data type) to represent undefined pixels.  The `BLANK'  FITS
header keyword with the format

BLANK = value  / This is the value of undefined pixels

where  `value'  is the integer null pixel value, should be added
to the header by including it in the  ASCII  file  specified  by
the   HEADFILE  parameter.   For  floating  point  format images
(BITPIX = -32 or -64) a special IEEE NaN value is used  to  flag
any  undefined pixels and the BLANK keyword must not be use.  In
this case one may use the NULLVAL parameter to specify the  data
value  in  the  input  template  file which is used to represent
null values.  If the NULLTEST parameter is set = yes,  then  the
IEEE  NaN  value  will  be written in the FITS image in place of
this value.

<p>
<dt>outfile [filename]
<dd>
The name of the output FITS file.  

<p>
<dt>(headfile = "")
<dd>The name of the optional file of header keywords. Each
line  of this file defines one keyword, except that blank  lines
and lines beginning with # will be ignored. Each line
should usually contain three tokens: (1) the KEYNAME,(2) the
VALUE, and (3) the COMMENT string and must adhere to the
following format rules:
        
<p>
The KEYNAME token must begin in columns 1-8 and be a
maximum of 8 characters long.  If the first 8 characters
of the line are blank then the remainder of the line is
considered to be a FITS comment (with a blank keyword
name). A legal FITS keyword name may only contain the
characters A-Z, 0-9, and '-' (minus sign) and  '_' 
(underscore). This task will automatically convert any
lowercase  characters to uppercase in the FITS file. If
KEYNAME = 'COMMENT' or 'HISTORY' then the remainder of the
line is considered to be a FITS COMMENT or HISTORY record,
respectively.
<p>
The VALUE token must be separated from the KEYNAME token  by
one or more spaces and/or an '=' character. The datatype
of the VALUE token (numeric, logical, or character string)
is automatically determined and the output FITS header
record is formatted accordingly. Logical keyword values
are represented by a T or F (not enclosed in quotes). The
value token may be forced to be interpreted as a string
(e.g. if it is a string of numeric digits) by enclosing it
in single quotes.
<p>
The COMMENT token  is  optional,  but  if  present  must  be
separated  from  the  VALUE  token  by  at  least  one blank
space.  A leading '/' character may  be  used  to  mark  the
beginning  of the comment field, otherwise the comment field
begins with the  first  non-blank  character  following  the
value token.

<p>
<dt>(nskip = 0) 
<dd>Number of rows at the beginning of the data template file to
skip inclusive of any blank rows or rows beginning with '#'.

<p>
<dt>(history = TRUE)
<dd>If TRUE than a HISTORY keyword will be appended  to  the  output
FITS  file  giving  the  date that the file was created with the
ftimgcreate task.

<p>
<dt>(nulltest = FALSE)
<dd>As explained above, if NULLTEST = TRUE, than any pixels  in  the
input  ASCII  data  file which have a value equal to the NULLVAL
parameter will be designated as undefined pixels by setting  the
pixel  value  in the FITS file equal to the IEEE NaN.  This only
applies to FITS files with BITPIX = -32 or -64.

<p>
<dt>(nullval = "")
<dd>The floating point value that is used in  conjunction  with  the
NULLTEST  parameter to flag undefined pixels in the input image.
Only applies if BITPIX = -32 or -64.

<p>
<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]
<dd>If the output file already exists, then setting "clobber = yes"
will cause it to be overwritten.

<p>
<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer, 0 - 5]
<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard output.
Setting chatter = 5 will produce detailed diagnostic output, otherwise
this task normally does not write any output.

<p>
<dt>(history = NO) [boolean]
<dd>If history = YES, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written
to the header of the output file to record the value of all the ftcopy
task parameters that were used to produce the output file.

</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
1. Create  a FITS image called 'outfile.fits' containing  200 x 300
   short-integer pixels from  a  data  file  called  'data.lis'  and  a
   header file called 'keywords.lis'.

<p>
<pre>
   ft> ftimgcreate 16 200,300  data.lis outfile.fits headfile=keywords.lis


</pre>
