<h1>Calculator expressions</h1>

This help file describes the functions and operators that are
available for use when doing column filtering or row filtering 
of an input file.  See the 
<a href="colfilter.html">colfilter</a> and
<a href="rowfilter.html">rowfilter</a> help files for 
more information on these types of filters.

<h2>Boolean operators</h2>

Boolean   operators can be  used in  the expression  in either their
Fortran or C forms.  The following boolean operators are available:
<pre>
    "equal"         .eq. .EQ. ==  "not equal"          .ne.  .NE.  !=
    "less than"     .lt. .LT. <   "less than/equal"    .le.  .LE.  <= =<
    "greater than"  .gt. .GT. >   "greater than/equal" .ge.  .GE.  >= =>
    "or"            .or. .OR. ||  "and"                .and. .AND. &&
    "negation"     .not. .NOT. !  "approx. equal(1e-7)"  ~
</pre>

Note that the exclamation point, '!', is a special UNIX character,
so if it is used  on the command line rather than entered at a task
prompt, it must be  preceded by a backslash to force the UNIX shell
to ignore it.

<h2>Arithmetic operators</h2>

The expression may  also include arithmetic operators and functions.
Trigonometric  functions use  radians,  not degrees.  The  following
arithmetic  operators and  functions  can be  used in the expression
(function names are case insensitive).   A null value will be returned
in case of illegal operations such as divide by zero, sqrt(negative)
log(negative), log10(negative), arccos(.gt. 1), arcsin(.gt. 1).
   
<pre>
    "addition"           +          "subtraction"          -
    "multiplication"     *          "division"             /
    "negation"           -          "exponentiation"       **   ^
    "absolute value"     abs(x)     "cosine"               cos(x)
    "sine"               sin(x)     "tangent"              tan(x)
    "arc cosine"         arccos(x)  "arc sine"             arcsin(x)
    "arc tangent"        arctan(x)  "arc tangent"          arctan2(y,x)
    "hyperbolic cos"     cosh(x)    "hyperbolic sin"       sinh(x)
    "hyperbolic tan"     tanh(x)    "round to nearest int" round(x)
    "round down to int"  floor(x)   "round up to int"      ceil(x)
    "exponential"        exp(x)     "square root"          sqrt(x)
    "natural log"        log(x)     "common log"           log10(x)
    "modulus"            x % y      "random # [0.0,1.0)"   random()
    "random Gausian"     randomn()  "random Poisson"       randomp(x)
    "minimum"            min(x,y)   "maximum"              max(x,y)
    "cumulative sum"     accum(x)   "sequential difference" seqdiff(x)
    "if-then-else"       b?x:y
    "angular separation"  angsep(ra1,dec1,ra2,de2) (all in degrees)
    "substring"       strmid(s,p,n) "string search"        strstr(s,r)
</pre>
Three different random number functions are provided:  random(), with no
arguments, produces a uniform random deviate between 0 and 1; randomn(),
also with no arguments, produces a normal (Gaussian) random deviate  with
zero mean and unit standard deviation; randomp(x) produces a Poisson random
deviate whose expected number of counts is X.  X may be any positive real
number of expected counts, including fractional values, but the return value
is an integer.
<p>
When the random functions are used in a vector expression, by default
the same random value will be used when evaluating each element of the vector.
If different random numbers are desired, then the name of a vector 
column should be supplied as the single argument to the random 
function (e.g., "flux + 0.1 * random(flux)", where "flux' is the
name of a vector column).  This will create a vector of 
random numbers that will be used in sequence when evaluating each 
element of the vector expression.
<p>
An alternate syntax for the min and max functions  has only a single
argument which  should be  a  vector value (see  below).  The result
will be the minimum/maximum element contained within the vector.

<p>
The accum(x) function forms the cumulative sum of x, element by element.
Vector columns are supported simply by performing the summation process
through all the values.  Null values are treated as 0.  The seqdiff(x) 
function forms the sequential difference of x, element by element.  
The first value of seqdiff is the first value of x.  A single null 
value in x causes a pair of nulls in the output.  The seqdiff and 
accum functions are functional inverses, i.e., seqdiff(accum(x)) == x
as long as no null values are present.

<p>
In the if-then-else expression, "b?x:y", b is an explicit boolean
value or expression.  There is no automatic type conversion from
numeric to boolean values, so one needs to use "iVal!=0" instead of
merely "iVal" as the boolean argument. x and y can be any scalar data
type (including string).

<p>
The angsep function computes the angular separation in degrees 
between 2 celestial positions, where the first 2 parameters
give the RA-like and Dec-like coordinates (in decimal degrees)
of the first position, and the 3rd and 4th parameters give the
coordinates of the second position.

<p>    
The substring function strmid(S,P,N) extracts a substring from S, 
starting at string position P, with a substring length N.  The first 
character position in S is labeled as 1. If P is 0, or refers to a 
position beyond the end of S, then the extracted substring will be 
NULL.  S, P, and N may be functions of other columns.

<p>
The string search function strstr(S,R) searches for the first occurrence 
of the substring R in S.  The result is an integer, indicating the 
character position of the first match (where 1 is the first character 
position of S).  If no match is found, then strstr() returns a NULL
value.

    
<h2>Type cast function</h2>

    The  following  type  casting  operators  are  available,  where the
    enclosing parentheses are required and taken  from  the  C  language
    usage. Also, the integer to real casts values to double precision:
<pre>
                "real to integer"    (int) x     (INT) x
                "integer to real"    (float) i   (FLOAT) i
</pre>

<h2>Numeric constants</h2>

    Several constants are built in  for  use  in  numerical
    expressions:
<pre>
       #pi           3.1415...         #e            2.7182...
       #deg          #pi/180           #row          current row number
       #null         undefined value   #snull        undefined string
</pre>
    
    A  string constant must  be enclosed  in quotes  as in  'Crab'.  The
    "null" constants  are useful for conditionally  setting table values
    to a NULL, or undefined, value (eg., "col1==-99 ? #NULL : col1").

<h2>Approximation function</h2>

There is also a function for testing if  two  values  are  close  to
each  other,  i.e.,  if  they are "near" each other to within a user
specified tolerance. The  arguments,  value_1  and  value_2  can  be
integer  or  real  and  represent  the two values who's proximity is
being tested to be within the specified tolerance, also  an  integer
or real:
<pre>
                    near(value_1, value_2, tolerance)
</pre>

<h2>Null value handling</h2>

When  a  NULL, or undefined, value is encountered in the FITS table,
the expression will evaluate to NULL unless the undefined  value  is
not   actually   required  for  evaluation,  e.g. "TRUE  .or.  NULL" 
evaluates to TRUE. The  following  two  functions  allow  some  NULL
detection  and  handling:
<pre>
                    ISNULL(x)
                    DEFNULL(x,y)
</pre>
The former
returns a boolean value of TRUE if the  argument  x  is  NULL.   The
later  "defines"  a  value  to  be  substituted  for NULL values; it
returns the value of x if x is not NULL, otherwise  it  returns  the
value of y.
    
<h2>Bit masks</h2>

    Bit  masks can be used to select out rows from bit columns (TFORMn =
    #X) in FITS files. To represent the mask,  binary,  octal,  and  hex
    formats are allowed:
    
<pre>
                 binary:   b0110xx1010000101xxxx0001
                 octal:    o720x1 -> (b111010000xxx001)
                 hex:      h0FxD  -> (b00001111xxxx1101)
</pre>
    
    In  all  the  representations, an x or X is allowed in the mask as a
    wild card. Note that the x represents a  different  number  of  wild
    card  bits  in  each  representation.  All  representations are case
    insensitive.
<p>
    To construct the boolean expression using the mask  as  the  boolean
    equal  operator  described above on a bit table column. For example,
    if you had a 7 bit column named flags in a  FITS  table  and  wanted
    all  rows  having  the bit pattern 0010011, the selection expression
    would be:
<pre>

                            flags == b0010011
    or
                            flags .eq. b10011
</pre>
    
    It is also possible to test if a range of bits is  less  than,  less
    than  equal,  greater  than  and  greater than equal to a particular
    boolean value:
<pre>

                            flags <= bxxx010xx
                            flags .gt. bxxx100xx
                            flags .le. b1xxxxxxx
</pre>
    
    Notice the use of the x bit value to limit the range of  bits  being
    compared.
<p>
    It  is  not necessary to specify the leading (most significant) zero
    (0) bits in the mask, as shown in the second expression above.
<p>
    Bit wise AND, OR and NOT operations are  also  possible  on  two  or
    more  bit  fields  using  the  '&'(AND),  '|'(OR),  and the '!'(NOT)
    operators. All of these operators result in a bit  field  which  can
    then be used with the equal operator. For example:
<pre>

                          (!flags) == b1101100
                          (flags & b1000001) == bx000001
</pre>

    Bit  fields can be appended as well using the '+' operator.  Strings
    can be concatenated this way, too.

<h2>Vector Columns</h2>

    Vector columns can also be used  in  building  the  expression.   No
    special  syntax  is required if one wants to operate on all elements
    of the vector.  Simply use the column name as for a  scalar  column.
    Vector  columns  can  be  freely  intermixed  with scalar columns or
    constants in virtually all expressions.  The result will be  of  the
    same dimension as the vector.  Two vectors in an expression, though,
    need to  have  the  same  number  of  elements  and  have  the  same
    dimensions.   The  only  places  a vector column cannot be used (for
    now, anyway) are the SAO  region  functions  and  the  NEAR  boolean
    function.
<p>
    Arithmetic and logical operations are all performed on an element by
    element basis.  Comparing two vector columns,  eg  "COL1  ==  COL2",
    thus  results  in  another vector of boolean values indicating which
    elements of the two vectors are equal.
<p>
    Eight functions are available that operate on a vector and return a
    scalar result:
<pre>
    "minimum"      MIN(V)          "maximum"               MAX(V)
    "average"      AVERAGE(V)      "median"                MEDIAN(V)
    "sumation"     SUM(V)          "standard deviation"    STDDEV(V)
    "# of values"  NELEM(V)        "# of non-null values"  NVALID(V)
</pre>
    where V represents the name of a vector column or a manually 
    constructed vector using curly brackets as described below.  The
    first 6 of these functions ignore any null values in the vector when
    computing the result.    The STDDEV() function computes the sample 
    standard deviation, i.e. it is proportional to 1/SQRT(N-1) instead 
    of 1/SQRT(N), where N is NVALID(V).
<p>
    The SUM function literally sums all  the elements in x,  returning a 
    scalar value.   If V  is  a  boolean  vector, SUM returns the number
    of TRUE elements. The NELEM function  returns the number of elements
    in vector V whereas NVALID return the number of non-null elements in
    the  vector.   (NELEM  also  operates  on  bit  and string  columns, 
    returning their column widths.)  As an example, to  test whether all 
    elements of two vectors satisfy a  given logical comparison, one can
    use the expression
<pre>    
              SUM( COL1 > COL2 ) == NELEM( COL1 )
</pre>
    which will return TRUE if all elements  of  COL1  are  greater  than
    their corresponding elements in COL2.
<p>
    To  specify  a  single  element  of  a  vector, give the column name
    followed by  a  comma-separated  list  of  coordinates  enclosed  in
    square  brackets.  For example, if a vector column named PHAS exists
    in the table as a one dimensional, 256  component  list  of  numbers
    from  which  you  wanted to select the 57th component for use in the
    expression, then PHAS[57] would do the  trick.   Higher  dimensional
    arrays  of  data  may appear in a column.  But in order to interpret
    them, the TDIMn keyword must appear in the header.  Assuming that  a
    (4,4,4,4)  array  is packed into each row of a column named ARRAY4D,
    the  (1,2,3,4)  component  element  of  each  row  is  accessed   by 
    ARRAY4D[1,2,3,4].    Arrays   up   to   dimension  5  are  currently 
    supported.  Each vector index can itself be an expression,  although
    it  must  evaluate  to  an  integer  value  within the bounds of the
    vector.  Vector columns which contain spaces or arithmetic operators
    must   have   their   names  enclosed  in  "$"  characters  as  with 
    $ARRAY-4D$[1,2,3,4].
<p>
    
    A  more  C-like  syntax  for  specifying  vector  indices  is   also 
    available.   The element used in the preceding example alternatively
    could be specified with the syntax  ARRAY4D[4][3][2][1].   Note  the
    reverse  order  of  indices  (as in C), as well as the fact that the
    values are still ones-based (as  in  Fortran  --  adopted  to  avoid
    ambiguity  for  1D vectors).  With this syntax, one does not need to
    specify all of the indices.  To  extract  a  3D  slice  of  this  4D
    array, use ARRAY4D[4].
<p>

    Variable-length vector columns are not supported.
<p>
    Vectors can  be manually constructed  within the expression  using a
    comma-separated list of  elements surrounded by curly braces ('{}').
    For example, '{1,3,6,1}' is a 4-element vector containing the values
    1, 3, 6, and 1.  The  vector can contain  only boolean, integer, and
    real values (or expressions).  The elements will  be promoted to the
    highest  datatype   present.  Any   elements   which  are themselves
    vectors, will be expanded out with  each of its elements becoming an
    element in the constructed vector.

<h2>Good Time Interval Filtering</h2>

    A common filtering method involves selecting rows which have a time
    value which lies within what is called a Good Time Interval or GTI.
    The time intervals are defined in a separate FITS table extension
    which contains 2 columns giving the start and stop time of each
    good interval.  The filtering operation accepts only those rows of
    the input table which have an associated time which falls within
    one of the time intervals defined in the GTI extension. A high
    level function, gtifilter(a,b,c,d), is available which evaluates
    each row of the input table  and returns TRUE  or FALSE depending
    whether the row is inside or outside the  good time interval.  The
    syntax is
<pre>
      gtifilter( [ "gtifile" [, expr [, "STARTCOL", "STOPCOL" ] ] ] )
    or
      gtifilter( [ 'gtifile' [, expr [, 'STARTCOL', 'STOPCOL' ] ] ] )
</pre>
    where  each "[]" demarks optional parameters.  Note that  the quotes
    around the gtifile and START/STOP column are required.  Either single
    or double quotes may be used.  In cases where this expression is 
    entered on the Unix command line, enclose the entire expression in
    double quotes, and then use single quotes within the expression to
    enclose the 'gtifile' and other terms.  It is also usually possible
    to do the reverse, and enclose the whole expression in single quotes
    and then use double quotes within the expression.  The gtifile,
    if specified,  can be blank  ("") which will  mean to use  the first
    extension  with   the name "*GTI*"  in   the current  file,  a plain
    extension  specifier (eg, "+2",  "[2]", or "[STDGTI]") which will be
    used  to  select  an extension  in  the current  file, or  a regular
    filename with or without an extension  specifier which in the latter
    case  will mean to  use the first  extension  with an extension name
    "*GTI*".  Expr can be   any arithmetic expression, including  simply
    the time  column  name.  A  vector  time expression  will  produce a
    vector boolean  result.  STARTCOL and  STOPCOL are the  names of the
    START/STOP   columns in the    GTI extension.  If   one  of them  is
    specified, they both  must be.
<p>
    In  its  simplest form, no parameters need to be provided -- default
    values will be used.  The expression "gtifilter()" is equivalent to
<pre>
       gtifilter( "", TIME, "*START*", "*STOP*" )
</pre>
    
    This will search the current file for a GTI  extension,  filter  the
    TIME  column in the current table, using START/STOP times taken from
    columns in the GTI  extension  with  names  containing  the  strings
    "START"  and "STOP".  The wildcards ('*') allow slight variations in
    naming conventions  such  as  "TSTART"  or  "STARTTIME".   The  same
    default  values  apply for unspecified parameters when the first one
    or  two  parameters  are  specified.   The  function   automatically 
    searches   for   TIMEZERO/I/F   keywords  in  the  current  and  GTI 
    extensions, applying a relative time offset, if necessary.

<h2>  Spatial Region Filtering</h2>

    Another common  filtering method selects rows based on whether the
    spatial position associated with each row is located within a given 
    2-dimensional region.  The syntax for this high-level filter is

<pre>
       regfilter( "regfilename" [ , Xexpr, Yexpr [ , "wcs cols" ] ] )
</pre>

    where each "[]" demarks optional parameters. The region file name
    is required and must be  enclosed in quotes.  The remaining
    parameters are optional.  The region file is an ASCII text file
    which contains a list of one or more geometric shapes (circle,
    ellipse, box, etc.) which defines a region on the celestial sphere
    or an area within a particular 2D image.  The region file is
    typically generated using an image display program such as fv/POW
    (distribute by the HEASARC), or ds9 (distributed by the Smithsonian
    Astrophysical Observatory).  Users should refer to the documentation
    provided with these programs for more details on the syntax used in
    the region files.
<p>

    In its simpliest form, (e.g., regfilter("region.reg") ) the
    coordinates in the default 'X' and 'Y' columns will be used to
    determine if each row is inside or outside the area specified in
    the region file.  Alternate position column names, or expressions,
    may be entered if needed, as in

<pre>
        regfilter("region.reg", XPOS, YPOS)
</pre>

    Region filtering can be applied most unambiguously if the positions
    in the region file and in the table to be filtered are both give in
    terms of absolute celestial coordinate units.  In this case the
    locations and sizes of the geometric shapes in the region file are
    specified in angular units on the sky (e.g., positions given in
    R.A. and Dec.  and sizes in arcseconds or arcminutes).  Similarly,
    each row of the filtered table will have a celestial coordinate
    associated with it.  This association is usually implemented using
    a set of so-called 'World Coordinate System' (or WCS) FITS keywords
    that define the coordinate transformation that must be applied to
    the values in the 'X' and 'Y' columns to calculate the coordinate.
<p>

    Alternatively, one can perform spatial filtering using unitless
    'pixel' coordinates for the regions and row positions.  In this
    case the user must be careful to ensure that the positions in the 2
    files are self-consistent.  A typical problem is that the region
    file may be generated using a binned image, but the unbinned
    coordinates are given in the event table.  The ROSAT events files,
    for example, have X and Y pixel coordinates that range from 1 -
    15360.  These coordinates are typically binned by a factor of 32 to
    produce a 480x480 pixel image.  If one then uses a region file
    generated from this image (in image pixel units) to filter the
    ROSAT events file, then the X and Y column values must be converted
    to corresponding pixel units as in:
<pre>
        regfilter("rosat.reg", X/32.+.5, Y/32.+.5)
</pre>

    Note that this binning conversion is not necessary if the region
    file is specified using celestial coordinate units instead of pixel
    units because CFITSIO is then able to directly compare the
    celestial coordinate of each row in the table with the celestial
    coordinates in the region file without having to know anything
    about how the image may have been binned.
<p>

    The last "wcs cols" parameter should rarely be needed. If supplied,
    this  string contains the names of the 2 columns (space or comma
    separated) which have the associated WCS keywords. If not supplied,
    the filter  will scan the X  and Y expressions for column names.
    If only one is found in each  expression, those columns will be
    used, otherwise an error will be returned.
<p>

    These region shapes are supported (names are case insensitive):

<pre>
       Point         ( X1, Y1 )               <- One pixel square region
       Line          ( X1, Y1, X2, Y2 )       <- One pixel wide region
       Polygon       ( X1, Y1, X2, Y2, ... )  <- Rest are interiors with
       Rectangle     ( X1, Y1, X2, Y2, A )       | boundaries considered
       Box           ( Xc, Yc, Wdth, Hght, A )   V within the region
       Diamond       ( Xc, Yc, Wdth, Hght, A )
       Circle        ( Xc, Yc, R )
       Annulus       ( Xc, Yc, Rin, Rout )
       Ellipse       ( Xc, Yc, Rx, Ry, A )
       Elliptannulus ( Xc, Yc, Rinx, Riny, Routx, Routy, Ain, Aout )
       Sector        ( Xc, Yc, Amin, Amax )
</pre>

    where (Xc,Yc) is  the coordinate of  the shape's center; (X#,Y#) are
    the coordinates  of the shape's edges;  Rxxx are the shapes' various
    Radii or semimajor/minor  axes; and Axxx  are the angles of rotation
    (or bounding angles for Sector) in degrees.  For rotated shapes, the
    rotation angle  can  be left  off, indicating  no rotation.   Common
    alternate  names for the regions  can also be  used: rotbox <-> box;
    rotrectangle <-> rectangle;  (rot)rhombus <-> (rot)diamond;  and pie
    <-> sector.  When a  shape's name is  preceded by a minus sign, '-',
    the defined region  is instead the area  *outside* its boundary (ie,
    the region is inverted).  All the shapes within a single region file
    are OR'd together to create the region, and the order is
    significant. The overall way of looking at region files is that if
    the first region is an excluded region then a dummy included region
    of the whole detector is inserted in the front. Then each region
    specification as it is processed overrides any selections inside of
    that region specified by previous regions. Another way of thinking
    about this is that if a previous excluded region is completely
    inside of a subsequent included region the excluded region is
    ignored.
<p>
    The positional coordinates may be given either in pixel units,
    decimal degrees or hh:mm:ss.s, dd:mm:ss.s units.  The shape sizes
    may be given in pixels, degrees, arcminutes, or arcseconds.  Look
    at examples of region file produced by fv/POW or ds9 for further
    details of the region file format.

<h2>Region functions</h2>

There are three functions that are primarily for use with SAO region
files, but they  can  be  used  directly.  They
return  a  boolean true   or  false  depending   on  whether a   two
dimensional point is in the region or not:

<pre>
    "point in a circular region"
          circle(xcntr,ycntr,radius,Xcolumn,Ycolumn)
    
    "point in an elliptical region"
         ellipse(xcntr,ycntr,xhlf_wdth,yhlf_wdth,rotation,Xcolumn,Ycolumn)
    
    "point in a rectangular region"
             box(xcntr,ycntr,xfll_wdth,yfll_wdth,rotation,Xcolumn,Ycolumn)
    
    where 
       (xcntr,ycntr) are the (x,y) position of the center of the region
       (xhlf_wdth,yhlf_wdth) are the (x,y) half widths of the region
       (xfll_wdth,yfll_wdth) are the (x,y) full widths of the region
       (radius) is half the diameter of the circle
       (rotation) is the angle(degrees) that the region is rotated with
             respect to (xcntr,ycntr)
       (Xcoord,Ycoord) are the (x,y) coordinates to test, usually column
             names
       NOTE: each parameter can itself be an expression, not merely a
             column name or constant.

<h2>Example Row Filters</h2>
<pre>
    [ binary && mag <= 5.0]        - Extract all binary stars brighter
                                     than  fifth magnitude (note that
                                     the initial space is necessary to
                                     prevent it from being treated as a
                                     binning specification)

    [#row >= 125 && #row <= 175]   - Extract row numbers 125 through 175

    [IMAGE[4,5] .gt. 100]          - Extract all rows that have the
                                     (4,5) component of the IMAGE column
                                     greater than 100

    [abs(sin(theta * #deg)) < 0.5] - Extract all rows having the
                                     absolute value of the sine of theta
                                     less  than a half, where the angles
                                     are tabulated in degrees

                                     spectrum, held in vector column
                                     SPEC, with at least one value 3
                                     times greater than the background
                                     level held in a keyword, BACKGRND

    [VCOL=={1,4,2}]                - Extract all rows whose vector column
                                     VCOL contains the 3-elements 1, 4, and
                                     2.

    [@rowFilter.txt]               - Extract rows using the expression
                                     contained within the text file
                                     rowFilter.txt

    [gtifilter()]                  - Search the current file for a GTI
				     extension,  filter  the TIME
				     column in the current table, using
				     START/STOP times taken from
				     columns in the GTI  extension

    [regfilter("pow.reg")]         - Extract rows which have a coordinate
                                     (as given in the X and Y columns) 
                                     within the spatial region specified
                                     in the pow.reg region file. 

    [regfilter("pow.reg", Xs, Ys)] - Same as above, except that the
                                     Xs and Ys columns will be used
                                     to determine the coordinate of each
