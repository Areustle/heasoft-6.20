<h1>Binning or Histogramming Specification</h1>

One of the powerful features of CFITSIO's virtual file syntax is the
ability to create a 2-dimensional image (or 'histogram') on the fly by
binning the values in a pair of columns in a FITS table.  This is
frequently used with 'event list' tables to bin the columns that
contain the X and Y coordinate of each event to create a FITS primary
array image of all the events.  Each pixel in the 2-dimensional
histogram records the number of events that occur within the spatial
coordinates defined by of that pixel.  The virtual FITS file that is
opened by the application program consists only of the primary array
image and not the FITS table from which it was constructed.
<p>
This technique is not limited to just creating 2 dimensional images.
It can also be used to create a 1-dimensional array (e.g., a spectrum
or light curve) by binning a single table column, or a 3 or 4
dimensional data cube by binning over 3 or 4 columns.

<h2>Binning Syntax</h2>

The binning filter begins with the string 'bin' enclosed in square
brackets, and is appended to the root file name and optional extension
specifier.  There are several forms of binning filter, and the general
syntax is:
<pre>

  [bin{bijrd} Xcol=min:max:binsize, Ycol= ..., Zcol=...; weight]

  or

  [bin{bijrd} (Xcol, Ycol, ...) = min:max:binsize; weight]

  or

  [bin{bijrd} @file.txt]

</pre>

By default the created primary array image will have a 32-bit signed
integer datatype  except if the weighting option  is also specified in
which case the image will have  a 32-bit floating point data type.  The
default datatype may be overridden by appending a code letter to the
'bin' keyword as follows:
<pre>
   binb -  8-bit unsigned byte
   bini - 16-bit signed integers
   binj - 32-bit signed integers
   binr - 32-bit floating points
   bind - 64-bit double precision
</pre>

For example, 
<pre>
   file.fits[events][bini detx = 1:500:10, dety = 1:500:10]
</pre>
means "bin the DETX and DETY columns in the EVENTS extension over the
range from 1 to 500 using a bin size of 10 in both dimensions.  This
will create a 50 by 50 pixel 16-bit integer image.  Since these are
integer data type columns, the min and max range limits are both
inclusive.  If the columns have a floating point data type then the
binning range includes the lower limit value but excludes the upper
limit value.
<p>
In the general case, as shown in the above example, the column name 
is  followed by  an  equals sign and then  the
lower and   upper range  of the   histogram,  and  the size  of  the
histogram bins, separated by colons.   Spaces are allowed before and
after the  equals sign but not  within the 'min:max:binsize' string.
The min, max and  binsize values may  be  integer or floating  point
numbers, or they may be  the names of keywords in  the header of the
table.  If the latter, then the value of that keyword is substituted
into the expression.
<p>
If the binning ranges or size are not specified, CFITSIO will use
default values as given by the TLMINn, TLMAXn, and TDBINn  keywords
(where 'n' represents the column number) if they exist in table
header.  If the keywords do  not exist then the  actual minimum and
maximum values in the column will be used for the histogram min  and
max values and the default binsize will be set to 1, or (max - min) /
20., whichever is smaller.
<p>
The column names  are case  insensitive, and the
column number may be given instead of  the name, preceded by a pound
sign  (e.g., [bin #4=1:512]).  If the column  name is not specified,
then CFITSIO  will first try to use  the  'preferred columns' as
specified by the CPREF keyword (e.g., 'CPREF = 'DETX,DETY') if it 
exists, otherwise column names 'X', 'Y', 'Z', and 'T' will  be 
assumed for each of the 4 axes, respectively.
<p>
The following example illustrated the possible variations in syntax:
<pre>
       [bin x = :512:2]  - use default minimum value
       [bin x = 1::2]    - use default maximum value
       [bin x = 1:512]   - use default bin size
       [bin x = 1:]      - use default maximum value and bin size
       [bin x = :512]    - use default minimum value and bin size
       [bin x = 2]       - use default minimum and maximum values
       [bin x]           - use default minimum, maximum and bin size

       [bin 4]           - default 2-D image, bin size = 4 in both axes
       [bin]             - default 2-D image
</pre>

<p>
A shortcut notation is allowed if all the columns/axes have the same
binning specification.  In  this case all   the column names may  be
listed   within parentheses,     followed by  the  (single)  binning
specification, as in:
<pre>
   [bin (X,Y)=1:512:2]
   [bin (X,Y) = 5]      - use bin size = 5

</pre>

The  optional  weighting  factor is  the  last  item in  the binning
specifier and, if present, is separated  from the list of columns by
a semi-colon.  As the histogram is accumulated,  this weight is used
to incremented the value of  the appropriated bin in the  histogram.
If the weighting factor is not specified,  then the default weight =
1 is assumed.   The weighting factor  may be  a constant integer  or
floating point number,  or  the name of   a  keyword containing  the
weighting value.  Or the weighting factor may be the name of a table
column  in  which case the   value in that column,  on  a row by row
basis, will be used.
<p>
In some cases, the column or keyword  may give the reciprocal of the
actual   weight  value that is  needed.   In  this case, precede the
weight keyword or column name by a slash  '/' to tell CFITSIO to use
the reciprocal of the value when constructing the histogram.
<p>
For complex or   commonly used histograms,  one can   also place its
description  into  a  text  file and  import   it  into the  binning
specification using  the syntax  '[bin{bijrd} @filename.txt]'.   The
file's  contents can extend  over multiple  lines,  although it must
still  conform to the no-spaces  rule for the min:max:binsize syntax
and each axis specification must still be comma-separated. Any lines
in the external text file that begin with 2 slash characters ('//')
will be ignored and may be used to add comments into the file.

<h2>Combined Filtering</h2>

The binning specifier can be combined with other filters to make
an image of only selected rows in the table.  For example:
<pre>
  file.fits[events][pi < 100][bin (X,Y) = 1:500:10]
</pre>
will first create a virtual table containing only the rows that have a
PI column value less than 100, which will be used to create a virtual
image by binning the X and Y columns.  Similarly,
<pre>
  file.fits[events][regfilter("stars.reg")][bin (X,Y) = 1:500:10]
</pre>
will first filter the table to keep only those rows with X and Y
column values that are within the spatial region defined
by the 'stars.reg' region file.  All the pixels in the binned image
that lie outside the defined region will be equal to zero.

                                       of DETX and DETY columns, using

                                       the TSTART and TSTOP keywords, 
                                       with 0.1 unit size bins.  
 
    [bin pha, time=8000.:8100.:0.1]  - 2-D image using default binning
                                       of the PHA column for the X axis,
                                       and 1000 bins in the range 
                                       8000. to 8100. for the Y axis.

                                       binFilter.txt for the binning
                                       specifications.
