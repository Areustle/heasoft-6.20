<h1>Row Filtering Syntax</h1>

When entering the name of a FITS table that is to be opened by a
program, an optional row filter may be specified to select a subset of
the rows in the table.  A virtual FITS file is created by CFITSIO on
the fly (usually in memory) that contains only those rows for which the
row filter expression evaluates to true.  The primary array and any
other extensions in the input file are also copied to the virtual
file.

<p>
The row filter expression is
enclosed in square brackets following the file name and extension name
(e.g., 'file.fits[events][GRADE==50]'  selects only those rows where
the GRADE column value equals 50).   When dealing with tables where
each row has an associated time and/or 2D spatial position, the row
filter expression can also be used to select rows based on the times in
a Good Time Intervals (GTI) extension, or on spatial position as given
in a SAO-style region file.

<p>
The row filtering  expression can be an arbitrarily  complex series
of operations performed  on constants,  keyword values,  and column
data taken from the specified FITS TABLE extension.  The expression
must evaluate to a boolean  value for each row  of the table, where
a value of FALSE (or zero) means that the row will be excluded.

<p>
For complex or commonly  used filters, one can place the expression
into a text file and import it into the row filter using the syntax
'[@filename.txt]'.  The expression can be  arbitrarily  complex and
extend over multiple lines of the file.  Any lines in  the external
text file that begin with 2 slash characters ('//') will be ignored
and may be used to add comments into the file.

<p>
Keyword and  column  data are  referenced by  name.   Any string  of
characters not  surrounded by quotes    (ie, a constant  string)  or
followed  by an  open parentheses  (ie,  a  function name)  will  be
initially interpreted  as  a column  name  and its  contents for the
current row inserted into the expression.  If no such column exists,
a keyword of  that name will be searched  for and its value used, if
found.  To force the  name to be  interpreted as a keyword (in case
there is both a column and keyword with the  same name), precede the
keyword name with a single pound sign, '#', as in '#NAXIS2'.  Due to
the generalities of FITS column and keyword names,  if the column or
keyword name contains a  space or a  character which might appear as
an  arithmetic term then  enclose the name in   '$' characters as in
$MAX PHA$ or #$MAX-PHA$.  Names are  case insensitive.

<p>
To access a table entry in a row other  than the current one, follow
the  column's name  with  a row  offset  within  curly  braces.  For
example, 'PHA{-3}' will evaluate to the value  of column PHA, 3 rows
above  the  row currently  being processed.   One  cannot specify an
absolute row number, only a relative offset.  Rows that fall outside
the table will be treated as undefined, or NULLs.

<p>
Boolean   operators can be  used in  the expression  in either their
Fortran or C forms.  The following boolean operators are available:

<pre>
    "equal"         .eq. .EQ. ==  "not equal"          .ne.  .NE.  !=
    "less than"     .lt. .LT. <   "less than/equal"    .le.  .LE.  <= =<
    "greater than"  .gt. .GT. >   "greater than/equal" .ge.  .GE.  >= =>
    "or"            .or. .OR. ||  "and"                .and. .AND. &&
    "negation"     .not. .NOT. !  "approx. equal(1e-7)"  ~
</pre>

Note that the exclamation point, '!', is a special UNIX character,
so if it is used  on the command line rather than entered at a task
prompt, it must be  preceded by a backslash to force the UNIX shell
to ignore it.
<p>
All of the usual mathematical operators and functions may be used in the
expression.  There are also many other special functions available for
doing bit masking, for operating on vector columns, and for doing
spatial region file and temporal good time interval filtering.  See the
<a href="calc_express.html">calc_express</a> help file for a complete
description of all the functions.

                                     the initial space is necessary to
                                     prevent it from being treated as a
