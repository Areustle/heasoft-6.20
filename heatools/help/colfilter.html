<h1>Column and Keyword Filtering Syntax</h1>

The  column filtering specifier  can be used to create or modify table
columns and/or header keywords in the input HDU.  The
presence of a column filter causes CFITSIO to create a new virtual
file  (usually in memory) that contains the specified modifications.
Any other HDUs in the input file are also copied to the virtual file.
The actual physical input file is not modified.
<p>
The column filtering specifier must begin with the keyword 'col' and
is enclosed in square  brackets following the name of an input FITS
file.  The column filter   can be  used  to  perform the  following
types of operations.  More than one operation may  be specified by
separating them with commas or semi-colons.

<h2>Select a subset of columns from the input table</h2>

The list of columns to be included in the virtual table should be
separated by commas or semi-colons. For example,
<pre>
    file.fits[events][col X, Y]
</pre>
will create a virtual copy of the input events table that only contains
the X and Y columns.  The '*' and '$' wildcard characters may be used
to match the names of more than one column to be selected.  It is
sometimes more convenient to list the columns to be excluded from the
virtual table, as in:
<pre>
    file.fits[events][col -DETX, -DETY]
 or
    file.fits[events][col !DETX; !DETY]
</pre>
These examples will copy all but the DETX and DETY columns
to the virtual table.

<h2>Compute the values for a column</h2>

Append a new column to the  table or recompute the values in an
existing column.  For example,
<pre>
    file.fits[events][col PI = PHA * 1.05, X, Y]
</pre>
will modify the values in the PI column, (or will create a new PI
column if it does not already exist) using the arithmetic expression
'PHA * 1.05' (where PHA is a column in the input table)
to calculate the values for the column.  
The expression that is used to compute the columns or
keyword values can be arbitrarily  complex and may  be a function of other
header keyword values and other columns.  The full
syntax and available functions for  the expression are described  in
the <a href="calc_express.html">calc_express</a> help file.
<p>
In the above example, the virtual file will contain only 3 columns: PI,
X, and Y.  The '*' wildcard character may be used when specifying the
name of the columns to be copied to the virtual file, as in these
examples:
<pre>
    file.fits[events][col PI = PHA * 1.05, X, Y, *DET]
    file.fits[events][col PI = PHA * 1.05, *]
</pre>
In the first example, the virtual table will contain the PI, X, and Y
columns and any other columns whose name ends with the string 'DET'.
In the second example, the virtual table will contain all the columns
present in the input table, as well as the PI column.
<p>
When a new column is created, an appropriate data type will be chosen
by default based on the form of the expression used to calculate the
values.  Alternatively, one may specify the desired column data type in
parentheses, followed the column name, as in '[col PI(I) = PHA *
1.05]'.  The datatype is  specified using the same code letters  that
are allowed  for  the  value  of the FITS  TFORMn keyword (e.g., 'I'
for integer*2, 'J' for integer*4, 'E' for real*4, and 'D' for real*8,
etc.  for binary tables, and 'I8',  F12.3', 'E20.12', etc.  for ASCII
tables).  The full range of FITS data types is supported including
character string,  logical, bit,  byte and complex data types.  Vector
columns are also supported in binary tables.

<h2>Create or modify a header keyword</h2>

Create a new header keyword or modify the value of an existing
keyword by prefixing the keyword name with a pound sign  '#'.
The expression  must evaluate  to a constant scalar (i.e.,  cannot
have  a column  name in  the expression).   The comment   string for
the  keyword   may be specified  in parentheses   immediately
following  the keyword name (instead  of  supplying  a  datatype  as
in   the case of creating a new column). For example:

<pre>
    file.fits[events][col #VEL(radial velocity) = 23.4]
</pre>
will create the keyword
<pre>
  VEL     =                   23.4 / radial velocity
</pre>

COMMENT and HISTORY keywords may also be created with the following syntax:
<pre>
   #COMMENT = 'This is a comment keyword'
   #HISTORY = 'This is a history keyword'
</pre>
Note that the equal sign and the quote characters will be removed, so
that the resulting header keywords in these cases will look like this:
<pre>
   COMMENT This is a comment keyword
   HISTORY This is a history keyword
</pre>
These two special keywords are always appended to the end of the header
and will not affect any previously existing COMMENT or HISTORY keywords.

<h2>Rename a column</h2>

Rename an existing column or keyword  with the syntax 'NewName
== OldName', as in:
<pre>
    file.fits[events][col NEWPHA == PHA]
</pre>

<h2>Using a text file</h2>

For  complex  or commonly used operations,  one  can also  place the
operations into a text  file and  import it  into the  column filter
using  the syntax '[col @filename.txt]'.   The operations can extend
over multiple lines of the  file, but multiple operations must still
be separated by commas or semicolons. Any lines in the external text file that
begin with 2 slash characters ('//') will be ignored and may be used
to add comments into the file.
