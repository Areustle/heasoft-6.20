<h1>Tiled Image Compression</h1>

The CFITSIO interface for reading and writing FITS files (and hence 
most programs that use it)
supports a new image compression format in which the
image is divided into a grid of rectangular tiles and then each tile of
pixels is individually compressed.  The compressed tiles are stored in
rows of a variable length array column in a FITS binary table, but
CFITSIO recognizes that the binary table extension contains an image
and treats it as if it were an IMAGE extension.  This tile-compressed
format is especially well suited for compressing very large images
because a) the FITS header keywords remain uncompressed for rapid read
access, and because b) it is possible to extract and uncompress
sections of the image without having to uncompress the entire image.
This format is also much more effective in compressing floating point
images (using a lossy compression algorithm) than simply compressing
the image using gzip or compress.
<p>

A detailed description of this format is available at:
<a href=
"http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/compression/compress_image.html">
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/compression/compress_image.html</a>
<p>

The N-dimensional FITS image can be divided into any
desired rectangular grid of compression tiles.  By default the tiles
are chosen to correspond to the rows of the image, each containing
NAXIS1 pixels.  For example, a 800 x 800 x 4 pixel data cube would be
divided in to 3200 tiles containing 800 pixels each by default.
Alternatively, this data cube could be divided into 256 tiles that are each
100 X 100 X 1 pixels in size, or 4 tiles containing 800 x 800 X 1
pixels, or a single tile containing the entire data cube.  Note that
the image dimensions are not required to be an integer multiple of the
tile dimensions, so, for example, this data cube could also be divided
into 250 X 200 pixel tiles, in which case the last tile in each row
would only contain 50 X 200 pixels.
<p>
Currently, 3 image compression algorithms are supported:  Rice, GZIP,
and PLIO.  Rice and GZIP are general purpose algorithms that can be
used to compress almost any image.  The PLIO  algorithm, on the other
hand, is more specialized and was developed for use in IRAF to store
pixel data quality masks. It is designed to only work on images
containing positive integers with values up to about 2**24.  Other
image compression algorithms may be supported in the future.
<p>
The 3 supported image compression algorithms are all 'loss-less' when
applied to integer FITS images;  the pixel values are preserved exactly
with no loss of information during the compression and uncompression
process. Floating point FITS images (which have BITPIX = -32 or -64)
are first quantized into scaled integer pixel values before being
compressed.  This technique produces much higher compression factors
than simply using GZIP to compress the image, but it also means that
the original floating value pixel values may not be precisely returned
when the image is uncompressed.  When done properly, this only discards
the 'noise' from the floating point values without losing any
significant information.  The amount of noise that is discarded can be
controlled by the 'noise_bits' compression parameter.
<p>
No special action is required to read tile-compressed images because
all the CFITSIO routines that read normal uncompressed FITS images can
also read images in the tile-compressed format;  CFITSIO essentially
treats the binary table that contains the compressed tiles as if
it were an IMAGE extension.
<p>
When a program creates and writes a new output image with CFITSIO,
the user can indicate that images should be
written in tile-compressed format by enclosing the compression
parameters in square brackets following the root disk file name.   The
`imcopy' example program that included with the CFITSIO distribution
can be used for this purpose to compress or uncompress images.  Here
are some examples of the extended file name syntax for specifying
tile-compressed output images:
<pre>
    myfile.fit[compress]    - use the default compression algorithm (Rice)
                              and the default tile size (row by row)

    myfile.fit[compress GZIP] - use the specified compression algorithm;
    myfile.fit[compress Rice]     only the first letter of the algorithm 
    myfile.fit[compress PLIO]     name is required.

    myfile.fit[compress R 100,100]   - use Rice compression and 
                                       100 x 100 pixel tile size

    myfile.fit[compress R 100,100;2] - as above, and also use noisebits = 2
</pre>
<p>
The fimgzip and fimgunzip tasks in the HEASOFT software package 
can be used to compress or uncompress images in this tiled compression format.
