<h2>NAME</h2>

ftemplate - Create a FITS file from an ASCII template file.

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>ftemplate template outfile</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This task creates a new FITS file using a template to define the
structure of one or more HDUs within the file. The template file may be
another FITS file, in which case the newly created file will have
exactly the same keywords in each HDU as in the template FITS file, but
all the data units will be filled with zeros.  The template file may
also be an ASCII text file, in which case each template line is
processed in order and generally translates into one FITS keyword
record in the FITS file that is created.
<P>
The format of each ASCII template line closely follows the format of a
FITS keyword record:
<P>
<tt>  KEYWORD = KEYVALUE / COMMENT </tt>
<p>
except that free format may be used.  The KEYVALUE and COMMENT fields
are optional.  Any template line that begins with the pound '#'
character is ignored by the template parser and may be use to insert
comments into the template file itself.
<p>
The KEYWORD name field is limited to 8 characters in length and only
the letters A-Z, digits 0-9, and the hyphen and underscore characters
may be used, without any embedded spaces. Lowercase letters in the
template keyword name will be converted to uppercase.  Leading spaces
in the template line preceding the keyword name are generally ignored,
except if the first 8 characters of a template line are all blank, then
the entire line is treated as a FITS comment keyword (with a blank
keyword name) and is copied verbatim into the FITS header.
<p>
The KEYVALUE field may have any allowed  FITS  data type: character
string, logical, integer, real, complex integer, or complex real.  The
character string values need not be enclosed in single quote characters
unless they are necessary to distinguish the string from a different
data type (e.g.  2.0 is a real but '2.0' is a string).  The keyword has
an undefined (null) value if the template record only contains blanks
following the "=" or between the "=" and the "/" comment field
delimiter.
<p>
String keyword values longer than 68 characters (the maximum length
that will fit in a single FITS keyword record) are permitted using the
CFITSIO long string convention. They can either be specified as a
single long line in the template, or by using multiple lines where the
continuing lines contain the 'CONTINUE' keyword, as in this example:

<pre>

     LONGKEY = 'This is a long string value that is contin&'
     CONTINUE  'ued over 2 records' / comment field goes here
</pre>

The format of template lines with CONTINUE keyword is very strict:  3
spaces must follow CONTINUE and the rest of the line is copied verbatim
to the FITS file.
<p>
The start of the optional COMMENT field must be preceded by "/", which
is used to separate it from the keyword value field. Exceptions are if
the KEYWORD name field contains COMMENT, HISTORY, CONTINUE, or if the
first 8 characters of the template line are blanks.
<p>
More than one Header-Data Unit (HDU) may be defined in the template
file.  The start of an HDU definition is denoted with a SIMPLE or
XTENSION template line:
<ul>
<p>
<li>
SIMPLE begins a Primary HDU definition. SIMPLE may only appear as
the  first keyword in the template file. If the template file begins
with XTENSION instead of SIMPLE, then a default empty Primary HDU is
created, and the template is then assumed to define the keywords
starting with the first extension following the Primary HDU.
<p>
<li>
XTENSION marks the beginning of a new extension HDU definition.  The
previous HDU will be closed at this point and processing of the next
extension begins.
</ul>
<p>
AUTO-INDEXING OF KEYWORDS:  If a template keyword name ends with a "#"
character, it is said to be 'auto-indexed'.   Each "#" character will
be replaced by the current integer index value, which gets reset = 1 at
the start of each new HDU in the file.  The FIRST indexed keyword in
each template HDU definition is used as the 'incrementor';  each
subsequent occurence of this SAME keyword will cause the index value to
be incremented.  This behavior can be rather subtle, as illustrated in
the following examples in which the TTYPE keyword is the incrementor in
both cases:
<pre>

     TTYPE# = TIME
     TFORM# = 1D
     TTYPE# = RATE
     TFORM# = 1E
</pre>

will create TTYPE1, TFORM1, TTYPE2, and TFORM2 keywords.  But if the
template looks like,
<pre>

     TTYPE# = TIME
     TTYPE# = RATE
     TFORM# = 1D
     TFORM# = 1E
</pre>

this results in a FITS files with  TTYPE1, TTYPE2, TFORM2, and TFORM2,
which is probably not what was intended!
<p>
TEMPLATE DIRECTIVES:  In addition to the template lines which define
individual keywords, the template parser recognizes 3 special
directives which are each preceded by the backslash character:
\include, \group, and \end.
<p>
The \include directive must be followed by a filename. It forces the
parser to temporarily stop reading the current template file and begin
reading the include file. Once the parser reaches the end of the
include file it continues parsing the current template file.  Include
files can be nested, and HDU definitions can span multiple template
files.
<p>
The \group and \end directives have a more specialized use in defining
hierarchical groupings of related FITS files.   Refer to the CFITSIO
User's guide for more discussion of these directives,

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>template [filename]

<dd>Name of the template file.  It may be a FITS format file,
or an ASCII template file.
<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>Name of the new FITS file to be created.
</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

1. This template file will create a 200 x 300 pixel image, with 4-byte
integer pixel values, in the primary HDU.
<pre>

    SIMPLE = T 
    BITPIX = 32
    NAXIS = 2     / number of dimensions
    NAXIS1 = 100  / length of first axis
    NAXIS2 = 200  / length of second axis
    OBJECT = NGC 253 / name of observed object
</pre>

The allowed values of BITPIX are 8, 16, 32, -32, or -64,
representing, respectively, 8-bit integer, 16-bit integer, 32-bit
integer, 32-bit floating point, or 64 bit floating point pixels.
<p>

2. Same as example 1, except that the image is created in an IMAGE
extension instead of in the primary HDU.  The auto-indexing feature is
used to define the NAXISn keywords.
<pre>

    XTENSION = IMAGE 
    BITPIX = 16
    NAXIS = 2     / number of dimensions
    NAXIS# = 100  / length of first axis
    NAXIS# = 200  / length of second axis
</pre>
<p>
3.  To create a FITS  table, the template first needs to include
XTENSION = TABLE or BINTABLE to define whether it is an ASCII or binary
table, and NAXIS2 to define the number of rows in the table.  Two
template lines then needed to define the name (TTYPEn) and FITS data
format (TFORMn) of the columns, as in this example:
<pre>

    xtension = bintable
    naxis2 = 40
    ttype# = Name
    tform# = 10a
    ttype# = Npoints
    tform# = j
    ttype# = Rate
    tunit# = counts/s
    tform# = e
</pre>
The above example defines a null primary array followed by a 40-row
binary table extension with 3 columns called 'Name', 'Npoints', and
'Rate', with data formats of '10A' (ASCII character string), '1J'
(integer) and '1E' (floating point), respectively.  Note that the other
required FITS keywords (BITPIX, NAXIS, NAXIS1, PCOUNT, GCOUNT, TFIELDS,
and END) do not need to be explicitly defined in the template because
their values can be inferred from the other keywords in the template.
This example also illustrates that the templates are generally
case-insensitive (the keyword names and TFORMn values are converted to
upper-case in the FITS file) and that string keyword values generally
do not need to be enclosed in quotes.
