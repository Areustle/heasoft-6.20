<h2>NAME</h2>

ftpaste - Merge columns from 2 input tables into a single table.

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>ftpaste infile[ext][filters] pastefile[ext][filters] outfile</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

ftpaste creates a new table containing a copy of the columns and header
keywords from the first input table, plus the columns from the second
pastefile table.   This task is analogous to the Unix 'paste' command.
By default, all the columns from both the input table and the paste
table are copied to the output table, but a column filter may be
specified for one or both tables to only copy a subset of the
columns.  For example, if the input file is given as
'file.fit[events][col X;Y]', then only the X and Y columns from that
table will be copied to the output file.
<p>
The input table (or the virtual input table if a column filter or other
type of filter is applied to the file) is first copied verbatim to the
output file.  If the 'copyall' parameter = YES then any other HDUs in
the input file are also copied to the output file.  Then the columns in
the pastefile table (or virtual pastefile table if it is filtered) are
copied and appended to the output table.  Any standard keywords that
are directly related to the columns (e.g., TUNITn, TDISPn, or any of
the world coordinate system keywords for the columns) are also copied
to the output table.
<p>
If the paste table contains more rows than the first input table, then
only the number of rows in the input table will be copied.  If the
paste table contains fewer rows than the input table, then the
remaining rows in the output table will be set to zero (or blank if the
column contains ASCII strings).
<p>
Note that use of a column filter on the input table or paste table
normally requires that the resulting virtual table be constructed
entirely in memory before it is copied to the output file.  This
operation may fail if the virtual file is too large to fit in the
available memory.  In this case, it may be necessary to construct
physical files containing only the desired columns to be copied by
deleting the unwanted columns from a copy of the input and paste files
using the ftcopy task.  Alternatively, one may force the virtual file
to be constructed on disk, not in memory, by specifying an explicit
temporary output file (e.g., 'file.fit(tempfile.fit)[events][col -PI]').

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>infile [filename]

<dd>Input file name and optional extension name or number enclosed in
square brackets of the first table to be copied (e.g.,
file.fits[events]'). If an explicit extension name or number is not
specified, then the first table HDU in the file that is not a 'Good
Time Interval' (GTI) table will be used.  Additional filter
specifiers can be appended to the file name, also enclosed in square
brackets, to limit the number of columns and/or rows to be copied, as
shown in the examples.   The output table will contain a copy of all
the columns and all the keywords in the input table.
<p>

<dt>pastefile [filename]

<dd>Paste file name and optional extension name or number in square
brackets  of the table containing  the  column(s)  to  be appended  to
the copy of the input file file.  If an explicit extension name or
number is not specified, then the first table HDU in the file that is
not a 'Good Time Interval' (GTI) table will be used. Additional filter
specifiers can be appended to the paste file name, also enclosed in
square brackets, to limit the number of columns and/or rows to be
copied, as shown in the examples.
<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>Output file name. Precede it with an exclamation point, !, (or \!  on
the Unix command line), to overwrite a preexisting file with the same
name (or set the 'clobber' parameter to YES).  This file will contain a
copy of the table in the input file plus the columns in the paste
file.
<p>

<dt>(copyall = YES) [boolean]

<dd>If copyall = YES (the default) then any other HDUs in the input file
will also be copied, without modification, to the output file.  If
copyall = NO, then only the single HDU specified by infile will be
copied to the output file. 
<p>

<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If outfile already exists, then setting 'clobber = yes' will 
cause it to be overwritten.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard output.
Setting chatter = 5 will produce detailed diagnostic output, otherwise
this task normally does not write any output.
<p>

<dt>(history = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If history = YES, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written to the
header of the output table to record the value of all the ftpaste task
parameters that were used to produce the output file.

</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Note that when commands are issued on the Unix command line, strings
containing special characters such as '[' or ']' must be enclosed in
single or double quotes.
<p>

1.  Copy all the columns from the input events table and all the columns
from the table in the 3rd extension in the paste file to the output file.
Any other HDUs in the input file will also be copied to the output file.

<p>
<pre>
      ftpaste 'infile.fits[events]' 'paste.fits[3]' output.fits
</pre>

2.  Create an output table that contains a copy of all the columns in the
input events table except the X and Y columns, then append the X and Y
columns from the paste file to the output file.  Any other HDUs in the
input file are not copied to the output file. HISTORY keywords that
record the value of all the ftpaste parameters will also be written to
the output table header.

<p>
<pre>
      ftpaste 'infile.fits[events][col -X;-Y]' 'paste.fits[events][col X;Y]'
        output.fits copyall=NO history=YES
</pre>

3.  Copy only the X and Y columns in the 2 input event tables to the output
table.  The X and Y columns from the first input table are renamed X1
and Y1, and the X and Y columns from the paste table are renamed X2 and
Y2.  Note that FITS tables should never contain 2 columns with the same
name.  
 
<p>
<pre>
      ftpaste 'infile.fits[events][col X1==X;Y1==Y]'
        'paste.fits[events][col X2==X;Y2==Y]' output.fits
</pre>

4.  This example is similar to the previous one except that any other
columns in the first input table, in addition to the X and Y columns, are also
copied to the output table.  This is accomplished by specifying '*'
as one of the column names; this wild card matches every column, thus
forcing every column that is not specifically deleted to be retained
in the virtual table.

<p>
<pre>
      ftpaste 'infile.fits[events][col X1==X; Y1==Y; *]'
        'paste.fits[events][col X2==X;Y2==Y]' output.fits
</pre>

5.  This example is similar to the previous one except that only the columns
whose names end with 'raw' are copied, in addition to the renamed
X and Y columns.
 
<p>
<pre>
      ftpaste 'infile.fits[events][col X1==X; Y1==Y; *raw]'
        'paste.fits[events][col X2==X;Y2==Y]' output.fits
</pre>

6.  This example is similar to the previous ones except that only the first
500 rows in the input (and paste) table are copied to the output table.

<p>
<pre>
      ftpaste 'infile.fits[events][col X1==X;Y1==Y; *raw][#row <= 500]'
        'paste.fits[events][col X2==X;Y2==Y]' output.fits
</pre>

7.  In this example, the first table HDU in infile.fits is copied to the output
file, then the 'PHAcoor' column is appended to the output file containing values
that are calculated on the fly as a function of the PHA column in the paste table.

<p>
<pre>
      ftpaste infile.fits 'paste.fits[events][col PHAcoor=PHA*1.2]' output.fits
</pre>

fv, the interactive FITS file editor, can also be used to copy columns from one table to another.

The design of this task is based on the CXC dmpaste task and the ftabcopy task
in the ftools package.
