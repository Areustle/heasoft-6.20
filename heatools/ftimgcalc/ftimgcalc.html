<h2>NAME</h2>

ftimgcalc - create a new FITS image from computations on one or
more input images

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>ftimgcalc outfile expr a=img1.fits b=img2.fits ...</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
ftimgcalc performs general image computations on a set of input
images.  Multiple images can be combined using any of the mathematical
operators and functions supported by the CFITSIO calculator.

<p>
This task is similar to the ftpixcalc task, but has some additional
capabilities, most notably, the ability to perform calculations
based on 
world coordinates (e.g., the RA and DEC value of the pixels), or
ASCII region files, and the ability to process multiple FITS extensions
in sequence.
In cases where both ftpixcalc and ftimgcalc
can perform the same task, ftpixcalc will usually require less
computer memory and, in principle, may run faster.

<p>
All the input images should have of the same dimensions and, if they are sky
images, should refer to the same pointing direction.  ftimgcalc does
not do mosaicking or interpolation of images from different pointings
on the sky.

<p>
Up to 26 input images may be specified with the task parameters 'a' through 'z'.
By default, the same (case insensitive) letter is used as the  
variable name in the calculator expression.  For example, in this invocation,

<p>
<pre>
  ftimgcalc outfile.fits '(A-B)/C' a=img1.fits \
      b=img2.fits  c=img3.fits
</pre>

<p>
the images img1.fits, img2.fits, and img3.fits are substituted into the
expression for A, B, and C, respectively.  The calculations are 
performed using the corresponding pixels from each image.

<p>
It is also possible to specify symbolic names for each image, as
in, a="SKY=image.fits",
in which case you could use the name "SKY" in the expression instead
of the letter "a".  For
example,

<p>
<pre>
  ftimgcalc outfile.fits '(DATA-MODEL)/ERROR' a="DATA=img1.fits" \
      b="MODEL=img2.fits" c="ERROR=img3.fits"
</pre>

<p>
has the same function as the first example, but  with more
meaningful names.  Note that the quote characters must enclose the
image parameter values when symbolic names are given.
If a symbolic name is specified, then it must be used in the expression
instead of the parameter letter.

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Since the keywords <tt>T</tt> and <tt>F</tt>
are reserved by the CFITSIO parser for 'true' and 'false' you should
avoid using parameters 'T' and 'F' unless you use the t=VAR=filename
syntax to rename them.

<p>
By default, the first non-null image HDU in each input FITS file
is opened, but the standard
CFITSIO "filename[extension]" or "filename+n" syntax can be used to select any
specific extension in a file.

<p>
Any valid CFITSIO calculator expression can be used, including all the
usual mathmatical operators and functions. 
See the calc_express help file for a complete list of all the allowed functions.
Rank-reducing functions like SUM(NAME) or STDDEV(NAME) can be used,
and produce a 1-pixel output image.

<p>
The expression may contain conditional logic as long as the expression as
a whole evaluates to a numeric value.  A C-like syntax is used for the 'if-then-else' 
conditional expressions:

<p>
<pre>
    (expression1 ? expression2 : expression3)
</pre>
If expression1 evaluates to true (not zero) then expression2 is evaluated,
otherwise expression3 is evaluated.   For example,
<p>
<pre>
    (a < 0. ? 0 : a)
</pre>
will set the output pixel value to zero if the pixel value in the
'a' input image is less than zero.  The use of conditional 
expressions is especially powerful when combined with the
REGFILTER() region filter or ANGSEP() angular separation
functions, as illustrated in the Examples 
section of this help file.

<p>
Expressions may use keyword values using the standard #KEYNAME syntax
of the CFITSIO calculator.  Keyword values are taken from the first
listed image on the command line.  In the example above, the keywords
of 'img1.fits' will be available in the calculator expression.  If
multiple images are specified (see next section), then the keywords
named in the calculator expression must be present in <i>each</i>
image extension of the first listed image file. (See Implementation
Notes for some compatibility issues.)



<h3>Multiple Images</h3>
<p>
The same operation may by applied to multiple image extensions in the
input FITS files in sequence by using the nvectimages parameter.  The
images must be sequential extensions in each input file; non-image
extensions are ignored.  

<p>
Sometimes it is desireable to apply an operation on a series of
images, where one of the operands is a single constant image.  For
example, one may wish to divide a series of 10 CCD raw images by a
single flat-field correction map.  In that case use the replicate=YES
option; any input files which do not contain the number of images
specified by 'nvectimages' will be replicated until they do.



<h3>Using World Coordinates</h3>

Before describing the use of world coordinates in the calculator
expression, it is useful to have a basic understand how ftimgcalc works 
internally.  In simple terms, each input image is first copied into
a column of a temporary FITS binary table (constructed in
memory).  Each image is stored in a separate column of the table in a
single cell (as a vector).  Next, the table calculator function 
that is built into the
CFITSIO library is used to evaluate the expression  on the
columns of this temporary table.  The result is  written into 
another column in the temporary table.  Finally, the results image is
copied from the table cell to the output FITS image.  
<p>
In addition to the columns containing the input images, the 
temporary binary table will also contain other columns containing the 
coordinate values associated with the pixels in each image.
Images can have
coordinate systems assigned by using the WCS (World Coordinate System)
keywords.  These keywords describe the plate scale and projection of
the image.  
<p>
By default the following sets of coordinates will be available
as columns in the temporary table, assuming that the appropriate
WCS keywords are present in the input image header.  If the image
has no WCS keywords, then only the columns giving the
pixel coordinates will be present.

<pre>

     System    Column Name           Description
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
     Celestial NAME.RA   or    Celestial (sky) coordinates (R.A. and Dec.)
               NAME.DEC
     World     NAME.CTYPEi     Any world coordinate system defined in the 
                               the image header (based on CTYPEi keywords)
     World     NAME.CTYPEi.a   Alternate world coordinate system "a"
     Pixel     NAME.Pi         Pixel number for axis i
     Image     NAME.Xi         Intermediate image coordinate for axis i
     Polar     NAME.THETA or   Intermediate polar coordinates 
               NAME.PHI
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
where "NAME" is image parameter name (a, b, c, ...) or the symbolic name 
for the image, if specified, and CTYPE is the coordinate name give by the
CTYPEn keyword.  For example, the R.A. and Dec coordinates for the 'a' image
will be give in the 'a.RA' and 'a.DEC' columns of the temporary
table, respectively. (The table column names are case insensitive).
<p>

<p>
These coordinate system columns are most commonly used in conditional
calculator expressions.   As a simple example, the
following conditional expression will set all the pixels
that have a declination value less than +30. degrees to zero:
<pre>
  "a.dec < 30 ? 0. : a"
</pre>
These coordinate columns are particularly useful when
combined with the ANGSEP() distance function, and the REGFILTER()
spatial region filtering function, as shown in some of the examples.

<p>
FITS images may have both a primary coordinate system and up to 26
alternate coordinate systems (labeled "A" through "Z").  These
coordinate systems are named with the WCS keywords CTYPE<i>ia</i>
(where <i>i</i> is the axis number and <i>a</i> is the optional
alternate coordinate system designator.  Any coordinate system with
any units can be used (although celestial coordinate systems are
required by the WCS standard to be in degrees).  Alternate coordinate
systems are referred to as NAME.<i>CTYPE</i>.<i>a</i>, where NAME is the
parameter name or symbolic name of the image, and 
<i>CTYPE</i> is the coordinate name (RA, DEC, etc).  If there is no
ambiguity, the ".a" part is optional.

<p>
The pixel coordinate values (NAME.P<i>i</i>) follow the FITS convention,
where the lower left corner pixel is centered at coordinate 1.0, and spans 
the range from 0.5 to 1.5..
Intermediate "Image" coordinates (NAME.X<i>i</i>) are cartesian,
defined as having CRPIXi and CDELTi applied, but not CRVALi and not
any projection.  Intermediate "Polar" coordinates (NAME.THETA and
NAME.PHI), also known as "natural" image latitude and longitude in the
WCS standard documents, and typically measure the co-latitude and
longitude about the image reference point.

<p>
Spatial region filters using the REGFILTER() function
and celestial coordinates can
be applied.  Also available are the CIRCLE(), BOX() and ELLIPSE()
primitive functions.  The result of any of these filtering expressions is a
logical (true/false) value depending on whether or not the center of
the pixel is located within the defined region.  
The filters can be applied in a natural
way using the above notation, for example,

<p>
<pre>
  REGFILTER("spatial.reg",NAME.P1,NAME.P2) ? 1 : 0
</pre>

<p>
locates pixels in the image which satisfy the spatial region and sets
the result to 1 for those pixels.  Note that for celestial regions,
the filtering values <b>must</b> be in <b>pixel</b> coordinates (which
is why NAME.P1 and NAME.P2 are used above).  A non-celestial region
file (linear or physical coordinates) can be applied directly as usual
using the desired columns.

<p>
By default, the WCS keywords of the output image are copied from the
first image extension of the first listed image file, if the keywords
exist.  In the example above, the world coordinate keywords of the
output image 'outfile.fits' are copied from 'img1.fits'.  This default
behavior can be changed using the 'wcsimage' parameter.

<p>
Internally, coordinate maps are given names by replacing NAME.XXX.A
with NAME_XXX_A.  Only those coordinate systems that are requested are
loaded into the calculator.  However, users should beware not to use
primary variable NAMEs that would conflict with the above derived
names.

<h3>Console Output</h3>

<p>
If chatter is set to 2 or higher, and the result of the image
computation is a single pixel, then the value will be printed to the
standard output.  This is useful for simple statistical measures of an
image (such as the average, standard deviation, median).  The output
format is "RESULT(N)=VALUE [UNITS]", where N is the image number,
RESULT is name given by the resultname parameter, and VALUE is the
computed value.  The units are in square brackets and optional,
depending on the units of the output image.  Null values are printed
as "#NULL".  It is possible to set outfile=NONE and get only console
output.

<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>

<p>
Currently, ftimgcalc is implemented in the following manner.  Each
input image file is opened.  The first image extension is read into an
internal memory table.  The result value is calculated and written to
the output.  Then the internal memory table is cleared and the process
starts again by reading the next image extension from each input file
(if any).  This approach requires that all input files be open at one
time.  If the CFITSIO library was compiled with a limited number of
open file handles, it may not be possible to open all 26 input images,
plus the two output images and one internal memory table, all at one
time.

<p>
Also, if the input images are gzipped or stored on the network, then
ftimgcalc may have to store all input files in memory at one time.  If
the input images are large, this may overwhelm the user's available
computer memory.  For large inputs, the best strategy is to have all
inputs locally on disk, and unzipped before calling ftimgcalc.

<p>
In ftimgcalc version 1.12 and earlier, keywords were only taken from
the first image extension of the first file and replicated for later
extensions.  In ftimgcalc version 2.0 and later, this behavior was
fixed so that each input image keywords are available on an
extension-by-extension basis.


<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>The name of the output image file, or NONE if only console
output is expected.
<p>

<dt>expr [string]

<dd>An arbitrary calculator expression, whose result will be saved in
outfile.  The variable names that can be used in the expression are
defined by which images are loaded.  See the calc_express help file
for a list of all the supported operators, functions, and predefined
constants.  A text file containing the expression may be specified by
preceding the filename with '@', such as '@file.txt'.  The expression
in the file can be arbitrarily complex and extend over multiple lines
of the file. Lines that begin with 2 slash characters ('//') will be
ignored and may be used to add comments to the file.
<p>

<dt>(<i>letter</i> = "NONE") [string]

<dd>An input image file name to be used in the expression.
<i>letter</i> can be any letter from 'a' to 'z'.  
If no input images are specified on the command line, then ftimgcalc
will sequentially prompt for a, b, c, ...., until a value of "NONE"
is entered.
There are two
possible forms for the image file name.  If a simple filename is specified,
(a=img.fits), then the image is referred to by the same parameter
letter in
the calculator expression.  In the second form, images can be renamed to a
different symbolic name, (a="NAME=img.fits"), in which case the image
must be referred to by the NAME used.  The quote characters must
be used to enclose the symbolic name and file name.
<p>
Input files can contain one or more image extensions.  Set the
nvectimages parameter to the number of images to be processed.  If a
file contains fewer than nvectimages image extensions, then an error
will be generated, unless replicate=YES.  If replicate=YES, then the
extensions in the input file will be replicated as many times as
necessary to fill all nvectimages image positions.
<p>

<dt>(nvectimages = 1) [integer]

<dd>Number of images to process at once.  See the input file parameter
and replicate for more information.
<p>

<dt>(replicate = NO) [boolean]

<dd>When processing multiple images, this parameter indicates whether
an input file which has too few extensions (fewer than nvectimages)
should be extended by replication to the full number. 

<dt>(diagfile = "NONE") [string]

<dd>Name of diagnostic file.  This file contains all the intermediate
expressions as a binary table with image cells.  This file might be
useful for debugging or to perform further computations.  Note that
the format of this file cannot be guaranteed to remain the same over
time, as ftimgcalc is improved.
<p>

<dt>(resultname = "RESULT") [string]

<dd>Name of the result.  The primary HDU will have HDUNAME="RESULT".
Subsequent image HDUs, if any, will have an EXTNAME keyword of the
form "RESULT_n", where n is the image number.  The diagnostic file
will have a column titled RESULT which contains the vector of result
images.
<p>

<dt>(bunit = "NONE") [string]

<dd>Describes how the units of the image are to be assigned.  Bunit is
the unit string to be given to the image BUNIT keyword, with the
following exceptions.  A value of "NONE" indicates that the output
image will have no units.  A value of ":NAME" indicates that the
output image will have the same image as the image referred to by
NAME as used in the expression.
<p>

<dt>(otherext = "NONE") [string]

<dd>Describes whether additional extensions are to be copied to the
output.  A value of ":NAME" indicates that any extensions which follow
the data in the image referred to by NAME will be copied to the
output.  A value of "NONE" indicates no extra extensions will be
copied.
<p>

<dt>(wcsimage = "INDEF") [string]

<dd>Describes how the WCS coordinate keyword of the output image are to be
assigned.  A value of "NONE" indicates that the output image will have
no WCS coordinates.  A value of ":NAME" indicates that the output
image will have the same WCS keywords as the image referred to by NAME
as used in the expression.  A value of "INDEF" choses the first image
(the "a" image) specified on the command line.
<p>

<dt>(bitpix = "INDEF") [string]

<dd>The data type of the output image, either as a FITS BITPIX integer
or TFORM code letter.  The calculator will general choose an 
appropriate data type for the output image based on the
calculator expression and the data types of the input images, but this
parameter can be used to override that decision.  Possible values:
<ul>
<li>"INDEF" or "0": natural default value;</li>
<li>"B" or "8": 8-bit integer (byte);</li>
<li>"I" or "16": 16-bit integer;</li>
<li>"J" or "32": 32-bit integer;</li>
<li>"K" or "64": 64-bit integer;</li>
<li>"E" or "-32": 32-bit floating point;</li>
<li>"D" or "-64": 64-bit floating point.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If the output file already exists, then setting "clobber = yes" will 
cause it to be overwritten.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard
output.  For single pixel output images, chatter = 2 prints the value
to the standard output; chatter = 5 always prints debugging information.
<p>

<dt>(history = YES) [boolean]

<dd>If history = YES, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written to
the header of the specified HDU in the output file to record the value
of all the task parameters that were used to produce the output
file.

</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>

1. Computes the absolute value of the function "(data-model)/error", where
each of the terms are images.

<pre>

  ftimgcalc output.img "ABS((DATA-MODEL)/ERROR)" \
    a="DATA=data.fits" b="MODEL=model.fits" c="ERROR=error.fits"
</pre>

2. Computes the sum of a vector of images.  v1.fits and v2.fits both
containing four image extensions.  The result file, output.img, will
also contain four image extensions, each being the sum of the
corresponding extensions in v1.fits and v2.fits.

<pre>

  ftimgcalc output.img "V1+V2" nvectimages=4 \
    a="V1=v1.fits" b="V2=v2.fits"
</pre>

3. Test if each image pixel is within 0.1 degrees (6 arcmin) from the 
(R.A., Dec.) =
(10.0,30.0) position (the values are given in units of degrees), 
and assign the output pixel value 1 if yes, and 0 if no.  This 
assumes that
image img.fits has the appropriate WCS keywords that define
the celestial world coordinate system in the image.

<pre>

  ftimgcalc output.img "(ANGSEP(IMG.RA, IMG.DEC, 10., 30.) .lt. 0.1) ? \
    (1) : (0)"  a='IMG=img.fits'
</pre>

4. This example is similar to the previous one, except that several
circular
regions are defined in an external ASCII region file (generally produced
by the user with an image display program such as ds9 or fv).  In this
example, the stars.reg file was created using the fv program, and 
contains the following lines:
<pre>
  # Region created by POW Fri Jun 02 02:51:59 PM EDT 2006
  # filename: ngc1316o.fits
  fk5
  +circle(3:20:49.16, -37:23:20.68, 1.741511')
  +circle(3:20:48.41, -37:17:13.32, 57.37199")
  +circle(3:19:07.81, -37:16:52.80, 54.50155")
</pre>
This region file define 3 circles in the FK5 celestial coordinate
system that enclose 3 objects of interest.  The following ftimgcalc
command will create an output mask image, where the pixels within
the circles have a value of 1 and all the other pixels have a value of zero.
Note that since the regions are defined in terms of celestial coordinates,
the 2nd and 3rd parameters of the regfilter function (i.e., the pixel
coordinates) must be given in projected pixel units, not celestial
coordinate units.

<pre>

  ftimgcalc output.img 'regfilter("stars.reg", A.P1, A.P2) ? \
    (1) : (0)'  a=ngc1316o.fits
</pre>

This example also shows that the entire calculator expression must
be enclosed in single quotes if double quote are used 
within the expression (around the region file name in this case).
