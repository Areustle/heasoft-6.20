<h2>NAME</h2>

ftdiff - Display differences between 2 FITS files.

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>ftdiff  file1  file2</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

'ftdiff' compares the 2 input files and reports any differences
in the header keywords or image or table data elements.
Various options are available to control the level of checking.
<p>
If extension  names and numbers  are  not  given  for  both  files, the
program will compare all the  HDUs.   If an extension  name or number
is given  in  one  of the file but not the other, then ftdiff will only
compare that single HDU in both files.
<p>
The header keywords in the 2 HDUs are first sorted alphabetically and
then the values are compared. The order of the keywords in the header
is not significant.  The  commentary  keywords (HISTORY,  COMMENT,  and
keywords with a blank name), and the CHECKSUM and DATE  keywords  are ignored
during the comparison.   Users  can specify additional  keywords to be
excluded by  supplying  a  list of names as the  value  of the
"exclude" parameter.  This  list  can   be  either a  string  which
consists  of  the keyword names separated by  commas, or the name of an
ASCII file preceded with an  '@' character.   In the latter case,  each
keyword  name should be listed on a separate line in the file.
<p>  
The '*', '?', and '#' wild card characters may be used when specifying the
names of the keywords to be excluded from the comparison, 
with the following interpretation:
<ul>
* - matches any string of characters
<br>
? - matches any single character
<br>
# - matches any string of digits
</ul>

For example, 'NAXIS*' will exclude 'NAXIS', 'NAXIS1', and 'NAXIS2', 
whereas 'NAXIS#' will only exclude the numbered NAXIS keywords and not 
the NAXIS keyword itself. The 
comparison of header keyword values can be turned off completely by 
entering '*' for the value of the exclude parameter.
<P>
Users  can   choose  whether  to  compare  keywords (excluding TFORMn
and TDISPn) as numerical values by setting the  cmpnum  parameter to
"YES".  If  the cmpnum parameter  is set to "NO",  then they  will
be  compared  as literal strings. For example, if cmpnum = NO, then
the program  will interpret  1.0E+02 and  100.0 as different values
even though they have the same numerical values.  If the 2 values
differ by less than the value of the 'tolerance' parameter (default
value = 0) then they will be considered to be equal.

<p>
To quickly determine if the image or table data units of the 2 files
are identical, run ftdiff with the 'caldsum' parameter set to 'YES' and
the 'cmpdata' parameter set to 'NO'.  This will compare the checksum
values for the 2 data units and report a warning if they differ.  To
determine exactly which image pixels or table columns are different,
run ftdiff with cmpdata = YES.  This is more time consuming then just
comparing the checksums, but will clearly identify any differences
between the 2 files.

<p>
Numerical quantities are flagged as different when their arithmetic
difference exceeds a certain threshold.  Users can supply both an
absolute and relative threshold using the "tolerance" and "reltol"
parameters.  For quantities x1 and x2 from file1 and file2, values
which satisfy this expression:
<p>
<pre>
   |x1 - x2| > tolerance + |x1|*reltol
</pre>
<p>
are considered to be different.  A relative tolerance may be
appropriate if there is a large dynamic range in values.  By using
both an absolute and relative tolerance, users can also guard against
the case when x1 is near zero.  The default tolerances are '0',
indicating that an exact match is required.
<p>
Virtual file filters may be applied to the input files to compare only
parts of the data.  A column filter may be applied to both files to
compare a subset of the table columns, as in this example which
only compares the X and Y column values:
<p>
<pre>
   ftdiff 'file1.fit[events][col X;Y]' 'file2.fit[events][col X;Y]'
</pre>
Similarly, one can just compare selected rows in the table, as
in this example which only compares the first 10 rows:
<p>
<pre>
   ftdiff 'file1.fit[events][#row < 11]' 'file2.fit[events][#row < 11]'
</pre>
The image subsection filters may be used to compare small areas of
2-dimensional images, as in:
<p>
<pre>
   ftdiff  'img1.fit[10:15,30:35]'  'img2.fit[10:15,30:35]'
</pre>



<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>infile1 [filename]
<dd>File name of the the first FITS file, followed by an optional
extension name or number enclosed in square brackets.
<p>

<dt>infile2 [filename]
<dd>File name of the the second FITS file, followed by an optional
extension name or number enclosed in square brackets.
<p>

<dt>(exclude ="") [string]
<dd>A comma separated list of keywords to ignore during the file 
comparisons.
Alternatively, the name of an ASCII file many be entered preceded
by an '@' character, where the file contains the list of excluded
keywords, one per line.  The '*', '?', and '#' wild card 
characters may be used in the keyword names.
<p>

<dt>(cmpnum = yes)  [boolean]
<dd>If set to YES, then the keyword values will be compared numerically, 
otherwise the value strings will be compared literally.
<p>

<dt>(tolerance = 0.)  [double]
<dd>Numerical tolerance.  If the values in the 2 files differ by
this amount or less then they will be considered to have the same
value.  
<p>

<dt>(reltol = 0.)  [double]
<dd>Relative numerical tolerance.  If the values in the 2 files differ
fractionally by this amount or less then they will be considered to
have the same value.
<p>

<dt>(caldsum = yes) [boolean]
<dd>Should  data checksums be computed and compared if the 
DATASUM  keyword  does  not exist?
<p>

<dt>(cmpdata = yes)  [boolean]
<dd>Should the data units be compared datum by datum (for images and tables)?
<p>

<dt>(hdumaxdiff = 256)  [integer]
<dd> Maximum  number  of  differences allowed in a HDU (including
keywords and data). If  the  number  of  differences  in  a  HDU
exceeds  this value then a warning message will be printed out
and the comparison test will be terminated for this HDU.
If hdumaxdiff is non-positive (i.e. negative or 0), all differences
will be displayed and counted for output in the numdiffs parameter.
<p>

<dt>(numdiffs)  [output integer]
<dd>Returns the number of found differences, up to but not exceeding
hdumaxdiff, unless hdumaxdiff is less than or equal to 0, in which
case all differences will be counted and reported.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer]
<dd>Controls the verbosity level of the output.  Currently
this parameter has no effect.
<p>
</dl>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Note that when commands are issued on the Unix command line, strings
containing special characters such as '[' or ']' must be enclosed in
single or double quotes.

<p>
1. Display the differences between file1 and file2, allowing a
tolerance of 0.0001 between the values in the 2 files.
<p>
<pre>
      ftdiff file1 file2 tolerance=0.0001
</pre>
<p>

2. Display the differences between the EVENTS extensions
in file1 and file2.  Any other extensions in the file will be ignored.
<p>
<pre>
      ftdiff 'file1[events]' 'file2[events]'
</pre>
<p>

3. Display the differences in only the X and Y columns in
the EVENTS extensions in the 2 files. 
<p>
<pre>
      ftdiff 'file1[events][col X;Y]' 'file2[events][col X;Y]'
</pre>
<p>

4. As above, but only compare the first 100 rows of the table
<pre>
      ftdiff 'file1[events][col X;Y][#row < 101]' 
                'file2[events][col X;Y][#row < 101]'
</pre>
<p>

5. Display the differences between file1 and file2 but ignore  the
keywords KEY2, KEY31 and KEY32.
<p>
<pre>
      ftdiff file1 file2 exclude="KEY2,KEY3*"
</pre>
<p>
6.  Same as the previous example, except that the
list of keywords to exclude is contained in an
ASCII file called 'keys.txt'.
<p>
<pre>
      ftdiff file1 file2 exclude="@keys.txt"
</pre>
<p>

7.  Same as the previous example, except that all
keywords are excluded from the comparison.
<p>
<pre>
      ftdiff file1 file2 exclude='*'
</pre>
