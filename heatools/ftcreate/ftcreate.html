<h2>NAME</h2>

ftcreate - Create  a  FITS  table  extension  from  ASCII   files 
describing the  format and content of the table.

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>ftcreate cdfile datafile outfile</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This task creates a new FITS file containing a table extension (either
ASCII or binary) by reading two ASCII format files containing (1) a
description of the table column formats and (2) the data contents of
the table. Optionally, a third ASCII file  may be specified (with the
headfile  parameter) which lists additional keywords to be added to the
header of the FITS table. Options are provided to skip a specified
number of rows at the beginning of the data file and to process only a
specified number of rows in the data file. By default all the rows will
be processed and written to the FITS table. The data file may be read
either in free format (default) or fixed format.


<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>cdfile = "" [filename]

<dd>The name of the input column description file. This is a
free-format ASCII text file containing one line for each  column  (up
to 999 columns) in the FITS table to be created. Each line
contains up to 5 values (tokens) specifying the attributes of
the particular column: column name, datatype, units, column
starting position, and column width. Every line must have a
column name and a data type token; the other three tokens are
optional. Column names and units are case sensitive, but the
data types are not. 
<p>        
The column name token is a character string which is written to
the FITS file as the value of the appropriate TTYPEn keyword.
The FITS standard recommends that only letters, digits, and
underscore be used in this field. Each column of the table
should have a unique name.
<p>
The datatype token must conform to the FITS rules for the TFORM
keyword for ASCII and binary tables, whichever is being 
created. The legal datatypes for FITS binary table extensions
are:
<pre>
           rL - logical
           rAw- character string of unit length w, and total width r
           rX - On/Off bits
           rB - unsigned 8-bit byte
           rI - 16-bit integer
           rJ - 32-bit integer
           rK - 64-bit integer
           rE - single precision floating point
           rD - double precision floating point 
           rC - single precision complex value
           rM - double precision complex value
</pre>
where  r  is  an  optional  numerical value giving the number of
elements in a vector column.  Multi-dimensional  arrays  can  be
produced  by  including  a  TDIMn keyword in the optional header
file (see below). 
<p>
In the case of X columns, the maximum supported vector length 
depends on the compiler: in environments where the size
of a C 'long' variable is 4 bytes, then the maximum
vector length is 32;  in environments where the 'long' variable
is 8 bytes long, then the maximum vector length is 64.  In both cases
the value that is given in the data file should be the unsigned
decimal or hex integer that has the equivalent binary
bit pattern. For 
example, to set only the first bit in an 8X column, the binary value
is 10000000 which is equivalent to decimal 128 or hex 0xA0.  To set all 8 bits,
the input value should be decimal 255 or hex 0xFF.

<p>
For strings, r is the  full  character  width
of  the  column (assumed 1 if not present) and w is the width of
each element, so the number of elements is r/w.  Without w,  the
column  is  treated  as  a single string of length r.  This task
supports up to a total of  999  elements  per  row.   Note  that
variable length arrays are not currently supported by this task.
<p>
For  FITS  ASCII  table  extensions,  the  following formats are
allowed:
<pre>
           Aw   - character string, 
           Iw   - integer
           Fw.d - single precision, fixed decimal point 
           Ew.d - single precision, exponential notation
           Dw.d - double precision, exponential notation
</pre>
where 'w' is an integer specifying the width of the  FITS  table
field, and 'd' is the number of decimal digits to be 
displayed.  Vector columns and complex values are not allowed
in ASCII table extensions.
<p>
The units token is an optional character string that is written
to the  FITS file as the value of the appropriate TUNITn
keyword; if it contains embedded spaces, then the whole token
should be enclosed in quote characters. The value of  NONE  may
be specified as a place  holder (required  if the following
column position and width token are specified).
<p>
The column position and width tokens are optional integers which
specify how to read the input data file using fixed format.
These give the starting position of the column (beginning at 1)
and the width of the column in the data file. For vector
columns, the starting position points to the  first element of
the column and the width is that for each individual element;
the elements must  thus be consecutive and uniformly spaced
within the  data  file. This also applies to complex number
pairs. If position and width tokens are not specified for ALL
the columns then the data file will be read in free format.
<p>

<dt>datafile = "" [filename]
<dd>The name of the input ASCII formatted data file which is
to be processed and copied to the FITS table. If datafile="-",
the data will be read from STDIN.  
Any blank lines or lines
beginning with '#' in the data file will be ignored.         
The file may be in either
fixed or free format.  The data file will be read
in free format unless the column  starting  position  and  width
have been specified for every column (see the 'cdfile' 
parameter description).
<p>
For fixed format data files 
each line of the data file corresponds to one row of the FITS
table.
Each line must contain a data value for every column of
the table (and every element in a vector column) in the same
order as given in the cdfile.
Each line of the text file may be up to 30000 characters long and
can contain a maximum of 999 data values per line.
If there are more than 999 data values in each row of the table
(e.g., if there are large vector columns in a binary table)
then the values must be wrapped around on multiple lines of
the data file using the free format described below. 

<p>
For free format data files, each line of data may contain up to 999
data values; the data values for a single row of a FITS table may be
wrapped around onto multiple rows of the ASCII template file, or
multiple FITS table rows may be present on a single row of the template
file.  Ftcreate will continue reading values from subsequent rows until
it reachs the end of the ASCII data file, or until 'nrows' lines of
data have been read.  If there is only a partial row of data at the end
of the data file it will be ignored.  
Each line of the text file may be up to 30000 characters long and
can contain a maximum of 999 data values per line.
<p>
Logical datatypes are represented by the letters T and F (or t
and f). The datatype of numerical columns does not have to
correspond to the datatype of the FITS column (e.g., integer
vs. real)  because this task will perform implicit datatype
conversion if required. ASCII string data values may be
enclosed in single quotes, but this is only required if the
string contains  embedded blanks.  To include a single quote  in
the string, use two single quotes in a row. On/Off bits datatypes
are represented by integer. The integer may be in decimal, octal(leading 0) or
hexadecimal (leading 0x or 0X).
<p>
Any undefined elements in the input data file should be
signified by the string 'INDEF' (with or without the quotes).
These elements are represented in a floating point column in a
FITS binary table with the IEEE Not-a-Number (NaN) value. If
undefined values need to be written to integer columns in a
binary table, or to any column in an ASCII table, then the the
'inull' or 'anull' parameters must also be defined.

<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]
<dd>The name of the output FITS file. The FITS file will have an
empty primary array followed by an ASCII or binary table
extension (as specified by the 'tbltype' parameter). 

<p>
<dt>headfile [filename]
<dd>The name of the optional file of header keywords. Each
line  of this file defines one keyword, except that blank  lines
and lines beginning with # will be ignored. Each line
should usually contain three tokens: (1) the KEYNAME,(2) the
VALUE, and (3) the COMMENT string and must adhere to the
following format rules:
        
<p>
The KEYNAME token must begin in columns 1-8 and be a
maximum of 8 characters long.  If the first 8 characters
of the line are blank then the remainder of the line is
considered to be a FITS comment (with a blank keyword
name). A legal FITS keyword name may only contain the
characters A-Z, 0-9, and '-' (minus sign) and  '_' 
(underscore). This task will automatically convert any
lowercase  characters to uppercase in the FITS file. If
KEYNAME = 'COMMENT' or 'HISTORY' then the remainder of the
line is considered to be a FITS COMMENT or HISTORY record,
respectively.
<p>
The VALUE token must be separated from the KEYNAME token  by
one or more spaces and/or an '=' character. The datatype
of the VALUE token (numeric, logical, or character string)
is automatically determined and the output FITS header
record is formatted accordingly. Logical keyword values
are represented by a T or F (not enclosed in quotes). The
value token may be forced to be interpreted as a string
(e.g. if it is a string of numeric digits) by enclosing it
in single quotes.
<p>
The COMMENT token is optional, but if present must be
separated from the VALUE token by at least one blank
space.  A leading '/' character may be used to mark the
beginning  of the comment field, otherwise the comment field
begins with the  first  non-blank  character  following  the
value token.
<p>
<dt>(tbltype = "binary")
<dd>Type of FITS table extension: binary or ASCII.

<p>
<dt>(nskip = 0) 
<dd>Number of rows at the beginning of the data template file to
skip inclusive of any blank rows or rows beginning with '#'.

<p>
<dt>(nrows = 0) 
<dd>No. of rows in the data template file to read inclusive  of  any
blank rows or rows beginning with '#'. If nrows = 0 (the
default) then the entire table will be read.
<p>

<dt>(morehdr = 0)
<dd>Reserve space in the FITS header for this many more keywords to
be added at a later time. One can always add more keywords to
a FITS file, but it is more efficient to reserve space for  them
in advance, rather than having to create more space later on.

<p>
<dt>(extname = "") 
<dd>Name for the output FITS extension, i.e., the value written to
the EXTNAME keyword.

<p>

<dt>(anull = "") 
<dd>The string to be used to represent undefined data values in  any
column  of an ASCII table. If this parameter is not set to a
blank (default) then the appropriate TNULLn keyword will be
added to the FITS file header for all the columns. This
parameter should only be defined if the data  actually  contains
undefined values (represented by "INDEF" character string).

<p>
<dt>(inull = 0)
<dd>The value to be used to represent undefined data values in any
integer column (data type = B, I, or J) in an output FITS
binary table. If this parameter is not set to a zero (default)
then the appropriate TNULLn keyword will be added  to  the  FITS
file header for all the integer columns.  This parameter should
only be defined if the data actually contains  undefined  values
(represented by "INDEF" character string).

<p>
<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]
<dd>If the output file already exists, then setting "clobber = yes"
will cause it to be overwritten.

<p>
<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer, 0 - 5]
<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard output.
Setting chatter = 5 will produce detailed diagnostic output, otherwise
this task normally does not write any output.

<p>
<dt>(history = NO) [boolean]
<dd>If history = YES, then a set of HISTORY keywords will be written
to the header of the output file to record the value of all the ftcopy
task parameters that were used to produce the output file.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

1. Create a  FITS file called  'outtab.fits'  with  a  binary  table
   extension   from  a  column description file called 'coldesc.lis', a
   free-format data file called 'data.lis' and  a  header  file  called
   'keywords.lis'.
<p>
<pre>
     ft&gt; ftcreate coldesc.lis data.lis outtab.fits headfile=keywords.lis
    
    
         The column description file (coldesc.lis) could contain:
    
            name 12A
            ra  E  degrees
            dec E  degrees
            rank  B  
            flag  8X
    
         The data file (data.lis) could contain:
    
            'Alpha Boot' 15.345   -12.346 3 0Xa9
            Vega       123.225  39.245  7   031
            'RR Lyrae'  34.46788 -36.9  1   12
    
         The optional header file (keywords.lis) could contain:
    
            INSTRUME  ROSAT  /    name of instrument 
            OBS-DATE  2002-10-28   date of the observation
            observer    'I. Newton'   principle investigator
            tempdet 98.6   /  temperature of the detector
            history This file was created with the ftools ftcreate task

</pre>

2. Create a 100-row table with no columns in an output file called 'empty.fits'.
<p>
<pre>
     ft&gt; ftcreate /dev/null /dev/null empty.fits nrows=100


</pre>

3. Create a sine wave output file 'sine.fits' by piping example number 2 above to ftcopy.
<p>
<pre>
     ft&gt; ftcreate /dev/null /dev/null - nrows=100 | \
            ftcopy '-[col X=#ROW*0.1 + 10; Y = 12*COS(X);]' sine.fits


</pre>

4. Create an output file 'random.fits' consisting of random points on the sky by piping example number 2 above to ftcopy.  This example creates a table with 2 columns, "RA", and "Dec" which are filled with random coordinates on the sky.  In addition, the TUNITn header keywords are written for each column.
<p>
<pre>
     ft&gt; ftcreate /dev/null /dev/null - nrows=100 | \
            ftcopy '-[col RA=random()*360.0;#TUNIT#="deg"; \
               DEC=random()*180.-90.;#TUNIT#="deg"]' random.fits


</pre>
