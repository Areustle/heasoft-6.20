<h2>NAME</h2>
ftpixcalc - create a new FITS image from a 
combination one or more input images.
<h2>
USAGE</h2>
<tt>ftpixcalc outfile expr a=image1.fits b=image2.fits ... </tt>
<h2>
DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
ftpixcalc is a general image calculator program that creates a new output FITS
image from a mathematical combination of one or more input FITS images.  Each pixel
value in the output image is calculated as a function (only) of the corresponding
pixel in each of the input images. Note that if the output image value 
depends in some way on
the location of the pixel in the image (either in pixel or world coordinates) then
the 
<a href="ftimgcalc.html">ftimgcalc</a>
program should be used instead of ftpixcalc.   The main advantage for using
ftpixcalc is that it requires a smaller amount of computer
memory, and in principle at least, may run faster than ftimgcalc.
<p>
The mathematical expression, given by the <b>expr</b> parameter, may be an
arbitrarily  complex function of the input image values.  By default, the input images
are represented in the expression by the letters a, b, c, etc.  For example to add
the first 2 images and divide the sum by a third image, the expression would be
"(a+b)/c".  One can also define more meaningful names for the images, and then use
those names in the expression, as shown in the following example,

<p>
<pre>
    ftpixcalc out.fits 'DATA-MODEL' a="DATA=in1.fits" b="MODEL=in2.fits"
</pre>

Here the names 'DATA' and 'MODEL' are used in the expression to represent the 
2 input images.
<p>
The expression may contain conditional logic as long as the expression as
a whole evaluates to a numeric value.  A C-like syntax is used for the if-then-else 
conditional expressions:

<p>
<pre>
    (expression1 ? expression2 : expression3)
</pre>
If expression1 evaluates to true (not zero) then expression2 is evaluated,
otherwise expression3 is evaluated.   This usage is further illustrated in the Examples 
section of this help file.
For a complete list of the functions that are allowed in the expression, see the
<a href="calc_express.html">calc_express</a> help file.

<p>
The output image will have the same dimensions as the first input image 
(given by the '<b>a</b>' parameter).  
All the header keywords in this first image are copied to the
output image.   By default, the output image will have the same data type (as given
by the BITPIX keyword) as the first image, but this can be overridden using the
<b>bitpix</b> parameter. Any other FITS extensions in the input files are ignored, 
so the output FITS file always consists of only a primary array image, with no
following FITS extensions.

<p>
Under normal circumstances, all the input images will have the same size dimensions, however 
if any of the
images  have fewer total number of pixels than in the first image, those images will
be effectively padded out with NULL pixels when calculating the pixel values in the
output image.

<p>
Note:  For simple expressions involving only a single input image, CFITSIO's 
on-the-fly pixel filtering capabilities can be used instead
of ftpixcalc or ftimgcalc (see the 
<a href="pixfilter.html">pixfilter</a> help file).
For example

<p>
<pre>
    ftcopy 'infile.fits[pix sqrt(x)]' outfile.fits
</pre> 
computes the square root of each input pixel value (in this case, the letter 'x' is
used to represent the input image pixel value) and copies it to the output file.


<h2>
PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd>The name of the output image file.
<p>

<dt>expr [string]

<dd>An arbitrary mathematical expression used to calculate the value of the
pixels in the output image.  By default the letters 'a', 'b', 'c', etc,
are used to represent the value of the corresponding pixel in
each input image, however, alternate image names
may be assigned when specifying the name of each input 
file (see the description of the next parameter).

<p>

<dt>(<i>letters a - z</i> = "NONE") [string] (26 individual parameters)

<dd>input filename (and optional extension name or number enclosed
in square brackts) for up to 26 input FITS images.  The 
names of these parameters are 'a' to 'z', as in 'a=image1.fits'
and 'b=image2.fits'.  In this case the letters 'a' and 'b'
are used in the calculator expression to represent the pixel
value in each image.
<p>
One may optionally specify a mnemonic name for each image, as in
a="DATA=infile.fits" b="MODEL=infile2.fits"  (note that the quotes
are required in this case).   The mnemonic names are then used in 
the calculator expression to represent each image.  The mnemonic names
are interpreted as case-insensitive.
<p>
The 'f' and 't' filename parameters must always be used with the
additional mnemonic name because otherwise these 2 characters would
be interpreted as the Boolean TRUE or FALSE value by the parser of the
input 'expr' mathematical expression.
<p>

<dt>(bitpix = 0) [integer]</dt>
<dd>BITPIX data type code value for the output image.
Allowed values are 0 (use the same BITPIX value as in the first
input image), 8 (unsigned byte), 16 (signed 2-byte integer), 32
(signed 4-byte integer), -32 (single precision 4-byte floating point) or -64
(double precision floating point).

<dt>(bunit = "NONE") [string]

<dd>value for the optional BUNIT keyword in the output image
that describes the physical units of the pixel values.
If the value is 'NONE' then the keyword will not be written
(or modified if it was already copied from the the first input file).

<dt>(clobber = no) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Overwrite existing output files?


<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer, 0 - 5]</dt>
<dd>Standard HEAdas verbosity parameter.

<dt>(history = yes) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Write parameter history?


</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>
1. Sum the two images i1.fits and i2.fits
<pre>

    ftpixcalc output.img A+B a=i1.fits  b=i2.fits
</pre>

2. Sum the 5th and 6th image extensions from the same
input file
<pre>

    ftpixcalc output.img A+B a='in.fits[5]'  b='in.fits[6]'
</pre>


3. Compute the absolute value of the function (a-b)/c, where
each of the terms are input images.

<pre>

    ftpixcalc output.img "ABS((a-b)/c)" \
      a="data.fits b=model.fits c=error.fits
</pre>

4. Same as the previous example except it uses more meaningful names
in the expression, and it forces the data type of the output image
to be single precision floating point (BITPIX = -32).

<pre>

    ftpixcalc output.img "ABS((DATA-MODEL)/ERROR)" \
      a="DATA=data.fits" b="MODEL=model.fits" c="ERROR=error.fits" \
      bitpix=-32
</pre>


5. Example of a conditional expression which copies the pixel value from
either the 'a' or the 'b' image to the output image depending on whether or not
the value in the 'c' image (which effectively serves as a mask) is greater
than zero.

<pre>

    ftpixcalc output.img "c>0 ? a : b" a=in1.fits b=in2.fits c=mask.fits
</pre>


6. Copy the input image, but change any pixels that have a value less than zero 
to the FITS null value (a reserved IEEE NaN "not-a-number" value in the case
of floating point images).  Note: if the
output image has an integer data type, then the BNULL keyword must exist in the
image header to define what integer value to use to represent null pixels.

<pre>

    ftpixcalc output.img "a<0 ? #NULL : a" a=in.fits bitpix=-32
</pre>


7. Copy the input image, but reset any null pixels to have a value of -99.

<pre>

    ftpixcalc output.img "isnull(a) ? -99 : a" a=in.fits
</pre>
