<h2>NAME</h2>

ftchecksum -- Verify or update the checksum keywords in a FITS file
or a list of FITS files.
    
<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>ftchecksum filename</tt> 
<br>
or
<br>
<tt>ftchecksum @filelist</tt>
    
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This  task  verifies or updates the CHECKSUM and DATASUM keywords in
each HDU of the input FITS file.  A list of files can be verified
by listing the file names in a text file, one file name per line, and
then entering the name of the text file preceded by an '@' character.
<p>
The CHECKSUM and DATASUM keywords are used  to  embed
a  32-bit  1's  complement  checksum  into each HDU of the FITS file
which can be  used  to  verify  the  integrity  of  the  file.   The
CHECKSUM  keyword  gives  an  ASCII  encoded  representation  of the
complement of the checksum for the entire  HDU.   A  valid  CHECKSUM
keyword  value causes the checksum for the whole HDU to have a value
of zero.  The DATASUM keyword  gives  the  32-bit  unsigned  integer
value  for  the  checksum of the data unit alone, stored as an ASCII
string.   Further  details  of this checksum algorithm have
been published by Rob Seaman in  the  Astronomical  Society  of  the
Pacific  Conference  Series,  Volume 77, "Astronomical Data Analysis
Software and Systems IV" and in a revised draft dated June 1995.
<p>
This task may be used to either verify the checksums in a file or to
update  the  checksum keyword values if they do not exist or are out
of date.  If the 'update' parameter has the default  value  of  'no'
then  the  input  file  is not modified and the checksums are merely
verified; a warning message is issued if  the  checksum  values  are
not  correct,  thus  indicating  that  the file has been modified or
corrupted since the checksum keywords were originally written.
<p>
If an existing FITS file does not contain the checksum  keywords  or
if the keyword values are out of date, then this task may be used to
compute the new checksum keyword  values  by  specifying  'update  =
yes'.   If  the  FITS  file  already has the correct DATASUM keyword
value in each HDU and only the header(s)  have  been  modified  then
the  CHECKSUM keywords can be quickly updated by specifying 'datasum
= no'.  Specifying 'yes' for this parameter will force  the  DATASUM
keyword  to  be  recomputed (which may take some time for large files)
and updated if necessary before  recomputing  the  CHECKSUM  keyword
value in each HDU.
<p>
Note  that  the  ftverify task also checks the values of the checksum
keywords if they are present.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>infile [filename]

<dd>Name of the FITS file to be checksummed.  A text file containing
a list of file names to be processed, one per line, can also be entered
by preceding the text file name with the '@' character.
 <p>

<dt>(update = no) [boolean]

<dd>Should  the  checksum  keywords be updated if they are no longer
correct? By default the checksum keywords  are  simply  verified
and a warning message is issued if they are not correct.
<p>

<dt>(datasum = yes) [boolean]

<dd>Should  the  DATASUM  keyword  be  verified  and  updated before
recomputing the  CHECKSUM  keyword  value?   If  this parameter is
set to 'No',  then  the
DATASUM  keyword  will  be assumed to be correct and will simply
be added to the checksum for the header to  generate  the  total
checksum for the HDU.
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 2) [integer, 0 - 5]

<dd>Controls the amount of informative text written to standard
output.  Setting chatter = 1 or higher will produce one line of output
per file, indicating whether all the checksum keywords are valid or
not.  If chatter = 2 or higher then a more detailed listing will also
be produced, showing the status of the CHECKSUM and DATASUM keywords in
every HDU in the file(s).  Setting chatter = 0 will turn off the text
output completely.
<p>

<dt>(allok = yes) [boolean]

<dd>This output parameter is set to 'Yes' if all the checksum keywords
in all the files that were checked are valid.  Otherwise, it is set to
'No' if any of the CHECKSUM or DATASUM keywords are invalid or missing
in any of the HDUs.  This may be useful in data processing scripts to
check if a file or a set of files all have valid checksums.

</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>
1.  Verify the checksum values, without updating the input file.
<p>
<pre>
      ftchecksum  test.fits
</pre>

<p>
2.   Verify the checksum keywords in the input file and update the
values if the keywords don't exist or have invalid values.  Chatter = 0
turns off all the diagnostic output.
<p>
<pre>
      ftchecksum  test.fits  update=yes chatter=0
</pre>

<p>
3.   Update  the  checksum keywords in a list of files contained in the 
filelist.txt text file.

<p>
<pre>
      ftchecksum  @filelist.txt  update=yes
</pre>
