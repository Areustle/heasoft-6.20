<h2>NAME</h2>

ftverify - Verify that a FITS file conforms to the FITS Standard.

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>ftverify infile</tt>
<p>
or
<p>
<tt>ftverify @filelist</tt>


<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This task reads a FITS file (or a list of FITS files) and verifies that
the format conforms to the specifications of the FITS Standard  "Definition
of the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)", Version 3.0, available

     - Binary table has PCOUNT > 0, but no variable-length array columns
     - Calculated checksum inconsistent with CHECKSUM or DATASUM
       keyword(***)
     - The HEASARC long string keyword convention is used without the
       recommended LONGSTRN keyword (****)

        (*) only checked when "testdata" is 'Yes'
       (**) only checked when "testdata" and "testfill" are 'Yes'
      (***) only checked when "testdata" and "tchksum" are 'Yes'
     (****) only checked when the "heasarc" is 'Yes'
</pre>

Every  HDU in the FITS file is checked in turn until the end of file
is detected. A summary table is printed to the terminal  (or  to
an  optional  output  file)  showing the structure of the FITS file.
A  listing  of  all the header keywords may also be produced. At the
end of the verification, a summary of the  warnings and errors in each
HDU are printed.
<p>
The amount of information that is displayed can be controlled with
the prhead, prstat and errreport parameters.

<p>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<dl>
<dt>infile [filename]

<dd>Name of the FITS file to be verified. If this starts with "@"
then it is assumed to be an ascii file containing a list of
files (one filename per line) to be verified.
<p>

<dt>(outfile = "STDOUT" [filename]

<dd>Name of output verification report file. If outfile is blank
or = 'STDOUT' then the results will be written to the
standard output device (usually the user's terminal) rather
than to a file. If preceded by a !, an existing file of the
same name will be overwritten.
<p>

<dt>(prhead = no) [boolean]

<dd>Should a listing of the header keywords be included in the
verification report?
<p>

<dt>(prstat = yes) [boolean]

<dd>Should a detailed verification report be produced?  If 'NO', then
only a 1-line pass/fail message will be printed.  In this case,
the OUTFILE and PRHEAD parameters are ignored.
<p>

<dt>(errreport = "w") [string]

<dd>The first letter of this parameter controls the level of error 
reporting, as follows: <br>

's' for "severe" - only report the most severe errors
<br>
'e' for "errors" - report all errors
<br>
'w' for "warnings" - report warnings as well as all errors
<br>
Any other letter will be treated the same as the 
default 'w'.

<p>

<dt>(testdata = yes) [boolean]

<dd>Should data values be read and verified?  If set = YES, then
all the columns in ASCII tables and the character string (A),
logical (L) and bit (X) columns in binary tables will be read and verified.
Image arrays, and the numeric type columns in binary tables are not
read because it is impossible for these datatypes to have an illegal value.
Setting testdata = No may improved the execution speed of the task at
the expense of  doing a less rigorous verification of the FITS
file.
<p>

<dt>(tchksum = yes) [boolean]

<dd>Should the checksum of the header and data be tested? The
tests are performed only if the CHECKSUM and DATASUM keywords
exist.
<p>

<dt>(testfill = yes) [boolean]

<dd>Should the bytes in the fill area be verified? The fill areas
are defined as a) gaps between ASCII table columns, b) bytes
following the END card within the same FITS 2880-byte block and
c) bytes following the end of the data within the same FITS
2880-byte block. The values of these fill bytes should have no
effect on the data in the FITS file, nevertheless, the FITS
standard requires that they have a zero, or in some cases, an
ASCII blank value. Invalid fill values may be an indication of
more serious problems in the file.
<p>


<dt>(heasarc = yes) [boolean]

<dd>Should the HEASARC conventions be verified? The HEASARC
conventions go beyond the offical NOST FITS Standard. At the
present time the only significant HEASARC conventions are  that
column names must begin with a letter and be unique within the
first 16 characters.
<p>

<dt>(numerrs = 0 ) [int]

<dd>Number of the errors found in the verification of the FITS file.
For multiple input files, this is the accumulated number of
errors over all the files.
<p>

<dt>(numwrns = 0 ) [int]
<dd>Number of the warnings found in the  verification of the FITS
file. For multiple input files, this is the accumulated number
of warnings over all the files.
<p>

<dt>(clobber = NO) [boolean]

<dd>If the output file already exists, then setting "clobber = yes" will cause it to be overwritten.
<p>

</dl>
<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>
1.   Verify the contents of the FITS file 'test.fits'.
<p>
<pre>
      ftverify test.fits
</pre>

2.  Verify  the  FITS  file  'test.fits'  and  print all the header
    keywords:
<p>

<pre>
      ftverify test.fits prhead=yes
</pre>

3.  Check the FITS  file 'test.fits' for only the most severe errors, 
    ignoring less significant errors and warnings: <p>

<pre>
      ftverify test.fits errreport=s
</pre>

4.  Verify a list of FITS files.  In this case 'filelist.txt' is an ASCII
text file containing the list of files to be verified, one per line.
Since prstat=no, only a single line of output  will be written per file,
stating whether the file passed or failed the verification.
<p>

<pre>
      ftverify @filelist.txt prstat=no
</pre>
