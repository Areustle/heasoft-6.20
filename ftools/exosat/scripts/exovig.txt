USAGE
    exovig -i instrume -x xpixel -y ypixel 
	    
DESCRIPTION

 The script returns the vignetting correction factor appropriate for a 
 given X and Y position in the EXOSAT CMA1 and CMA2 detectors. 
 The X and Y pixel position should be entered as the unbinned image 
 coordinates which range between -1024 and 1023 pixel.
 The correction factor is read from the vignetting map, which is rebinned 
 by a factor of 16 from the original detector size. The vignetting map
 was part of the original calibration files included in the FOT data.

 The output vignetting factor is the value corresponding to the rebinned 
 X and Y input position. Its value is > 1 for off-axis position and about 
 1 for on-axis and it is therefore a multiplicative factor for the observed 
 count rate. The vignetting map is identical for the CMA1 and CMA2 detector 
 but the pixel optical axis position is different in the CMA1 and CMA2 
 detectors.
  
FLAGS
     -h - Prints this help file

    the following flags require arguments
     -i - instrument [input value CMA1 or CMA2]
     -x - X pixel  [input value ranges -1024 1023]
     -y - Y pixel [input value ranges -1024 1023]
