NAME
    exoleuv - Estimate  the  stellar  UV  countrate  for  different  CMA
    filters
    
    
USAGE
    exoleuv filter sptype vmag bvmag
    
    
DESCRIPTION
       Exoleuv  calculates a rough estimate of the stellar UV count rate
       in different CMA filter. Many  observations  of  hot  stars  with
    EXOSAT     showed  that  UV  radiation  leaked through the filter to
    dominate the    X-ray count rate for bright enough UV  sources.  The
    'exoleuv'  provides     an  estimate good to 50%. The calculation is
    based on a UV calibration    of the CMA done by Fritz  Paerels  with
    Sirius  AB combined with an IUE    atlas of spectra of hot stars and
    Seaton's interstellar redding law.     The estimates is  given  only
    for   four   of   the   CMA  filters  (3000  Lexan,     4000  Lexan, 
    Polypropylene  and  Aluminum/Parylene)  and  only  for  stars     of 
    spectral  type  O,B  and  A. In all other cases (different filter or
       star spectral type) the UV count rate is set to zero.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    Filter [integer]
        The EXOSAT CMA filter number. The input values are 7=3000 Lexan,
        2=Polypropylene, 3=4000 Lexan, 6=Aluminum/Parylene.
    
    Sptype [string]
        The  spectral  type  of  the  star  e.g. O7 or B3 (no account is
        taken for the luminosity class).
    
    Vmag [real]
        V magnitude of the star.
    
    BVmag [real]
        E(B-V) color excess.
    
    
EXAMPLES
      Estimate UV rate in the EXOSAT CMA filter 3 (4000 Lexan) for a star of
      spectral type A1, magnitude 5.38 and  E(V-B)=0.02
