FIMGTRIM (April,1997)         ftools.fimage        FIMGTRIM (April,1997)



NAME
    fimgtrim - Resets the pixels, to  a  constant  value,  whose  values
    falls  below  a  given  low  threshold  and/or  above  a given upper
    threshold values.
    
    
USAGE
    fimgtrim infile threshlo threshup const_lo const_up
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    FIMGTRIM resets the pixel values to a value  (const_lo/const_up)  if
    the  pixel  value  falls  below/above  (threshlo/threshup).   Option 
    provided so that user can have the threshlo and/or  threshup  to  be
    INDEF, in which case, it will not check for.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [string]
        The name of the image file for statistics.
    
    threshlo [string]
        String   containing  the  lower  pixel  value  for  calculation. 
        Calculation is done inclusive of this value. A  value  of  INDEF
        indicates  that  no lower limit will be used in the calculation,
        in which case the  corresponding  constant  value  parameter  is
        ignored.
    
    threshup [string]
        String   containing  the  upper  pixel  value  for  calculation. 
        Calculation is done inclusive of this value. A  value  of  INDEF
        indicates  that  no upper limit will be used in the calculation,
        in which case the  corresponding  constant  value  parameter  is
        ignored.
    
    const_lo [string]
        Value to be reset to if the pixel value falls below threshlo.
    
    const_up [string]
        Value to be reset to if the pixel value falls above threshup.
    
    (type= a) [string]
        The type of resetting to be done, either absolute or percentage.
        For the initial release (April 1997), it has  been  kept  to  be
        absolute and later on will have option for percentage value.
    
    outfile [string]
        Output file name.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean])
        Flag  specifying whether or not a  pre-existing  file  with  the
        same  name  as that  requested as the output file from this task
        will be overwritten.
        
        
EXAMPLES 
    
    
1. To reset the pixels which falls below 2 to 0 and and above 10 to 0, 
    
    prompt>  fimgtrim  infile=file.img threshlo=2 threshup=10 const_lo=0
    const_up=0 outfile=file.out
    
    
2. To reset the pixels which falls below 2 to 0 and keep all other as 
    they are, then
    
    prompt> fimgtrim infile=file.img  threshlo=2  threshup=I  const_lo=0
    outfile=file.out
