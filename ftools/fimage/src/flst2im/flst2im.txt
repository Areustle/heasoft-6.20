NAME
    flst2im -- Create an output FITS image file  from  input  list  file
    containing a list of the coordinates and respective values.
    
    
USAGE
    flst2im infile outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
    This task will  read input data from either an ASCII  file or a FITS
    file containing columns of X, Y, and (optionally) VALUE and write as
    a FITS image file.  If no VALUE is given (on a per-line basis for an
    ASCII file  or universally for  a FITS file),  a value of 1  will be
    adopted.   Data   for  missing  X-,Y-  pixels   are  assigned  zero.
    Multiply-listed pixels have their VALUEs summed.

    An ASCII input file consists of any number of rows each containing 2
    or 3  values separated  by commas and/or  whitespace. Blank  rows or
    rows starting with '#' are ignored.

    If VALUE consists of all  integers, the output image will default to
    bitpix=32.  If at  least one VALUE is real (or  the FITS column type
    of VALUE  is real),  the output image  will have  bitpix=-32, unless
    overridden with the datatype parameter.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        Name of the input ASCII/FITS file with extension.  Extension  is
        assumed to be 1, unless it is mentioned.
    
    outfile [filename]
        The  name  of the FITS image file to which the image is written.
        It is written in the primary extension.
    
    (xcol = X) [string]
        Name  for the column  in the  input FITS  file containing  the X
        coordinate of the pixel.
    
    (ycol = Y) [string]
        Name  for the column  in the  input FITS  file containing  the Y
        coordinate of the pixel.
    
    (value = VALUE) [string]
        Name of the  column in the input FITS  file containing the value
        of the  pixel.  If blank  or set to  '-', each listed  X,Y pixel
        will be assigned a value of 1.
    
    xrange [string]
        Range  of  x  values to be included in the image. e.g 10.,20. If
        input is INDEF, then  xrange  is  calculated  from  minimum  and
        maximum   x-values.  The  ranges  can  be  separated  by  either 
        TAB,comma or a blank space.
    
    yrange [string]
        Range of y values to be included in the image.  e.g  10.,20.  If
        input  is  INDEF,  then  yrange  is  calculated from minimum and
        maximum  y-values.  The  ranges  can  be  separated  by   either 
        TAB,comma or a blank space.
    
    rows [string]
        The  range  of  rows  to be input. The default of '-'  means all
        rows are to be included. The first ten rows could  be  specified
        as  1-10  or  just  '-10'.  To include the first  ten  rows  and
        all  rows  from   900   through   the   last  (inclusive),   use
        1-10,900-. Also '1,3,7,23 will' include only those four rows.
    
    (nxbin = INDEF) [integer]
        Number  of  bins  in  x-direction.   If  INDEF,  xrange  will be
        interpretted as an inclusive range with  a  unit  binsize,  such
        that   nxbin   =   Xmax-Xmin+1.   Otherwise,   xrange   will  be 
        interpretted as a bounding box with Xmax values excluded.
    
    (nybin = INDEF) [integer]
        Number of  bins  in  y-direction.   If  INDEF,  yrange  will  be
        interpretted  as  an  inclusive  range with a unit binsize, such
        that  nybin   =   Ymax-Ymin+1.   Otherwise,   yrange   will   be 
        interpretted as a bounding box with Ymax values excluded.
    
    (datatype = ' ') [string]
        The datatype (or  bits/pixel) of the output image.   If blank or
        "-", the bitpix of the output image will be 32 or -32, depending
        on  the  datatype  of   VALUE.   Acceptable  inputs  are  (b,8),
        (i,short,16),   (j,integer,int,long,32),  (r,f,e,real,float,-32)
        and (d,double,-64).

    (clobber = false) [integer]
        Flag   specifying  whether  or  not a pre-existing file with the
        same name as that requested as the output file from  this   task
        will be overwritten.
    
    
EXAMPLES 
    1.  Construct an image file "image.fits" from an input file "list"
    
        ft> flst2im list image.fits
    
    2. as above, but with dimension as 512X512
    
        ft> flst2im list image.fits nxbin=512 nybin=512
    
    3. if name of Xcolumn is XCOLUMN, then
    
        ft> flst2im list image.fits xcol=XCOLUMN
    
    
    
    
NOTES:
    FLST2IM  uses  dynamic  memory  to  read  in  the  entire  list  and 
    construct an image list at  one  time.  If  the  requested  list  is
    larger than the available system memory, an error will be reported
