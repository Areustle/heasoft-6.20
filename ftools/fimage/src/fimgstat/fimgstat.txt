NAME
    fimgstat  -  Compute   statistics   (min,   max,  mean, etc..) for a
    given image file within a range of pixel values defined by  threshlo
    and threshup.
    
    
USAGE
    fimgstat infile threshlo threshup
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    FIMGSTAT  reads  an  image  file  and  displays  the  computed mean,
    standard deviation, number of included pixels, minimum  and  maximum
    values  of  the  pixel  included  along  with  their  locations. The
    minimum and maximum pixel values can be specified, outside of  which
    the  pixels  will not be included in the calculation. Option provide
    so that  user  can  have  either  the  maximum  and/or  the  minimum
    requested  to  be INDEF, in which case, it will take all the pixels.
    The output is written to  STDOUT  and  to  the  parameter  file   by
    default.  The output  can also be directed to a file.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [string]
        The name of the image file for statistics.
    
    threshlo [string]
        String   containing  the  lower  pixel  value  for  calculation. 
        Calculation is done inclusive of this value. A  value  of  INDEF
        indicates that no lower limit will be used in the calculation.
    
    threshup [string]
        String   containing  the  upper  pixel  value  for  calculation. 
        Calculation is done inclusive of this value. A  value  of  INDEF
        indicates that no upper limit will be used in the calculation.
    
    (outfile=STDOUT) [string]
        Optional  output  file  name to write the statistics. By default
        it is STDOUT and also to parameter file.
    
    (sum= ) [real]
        Value of the sum of the specified pixels  is  returned  to  this
        parameter.
    
    (mean= ) [real]
        Value  of  the  mean of the specified pixels is returned to this
        parameter.
    
    (rms= ) [real]
        Value of the rms of the specified pixels  is  returned  to  this
        parameter.
    
    (num= ) [integer]
        The  number  of  values  actually  used  in  the  calculation is
        returned.
    
    (min= ) [real]
        The minimum value of  the  pixels  in  the  requested  range  is
        written into this parameter.
    
    (max= ) [real]
        The  maximum  value  of  the  pixels  in  the requested range is
        written into this parameter.
    
    (xmin= ) [integer]
        Location (x-direction) of the minimum value  of  the  pixels  in
        the requested range is written into this parameter.
    
    (ymin= ) [integer]
        Location  (y-direction)  of  the  minimum value of the pixels in
        the requested range is written into this parameter.
    
    (xmax= ) [integer]
        Location (x-direction) of the maximum value  of  the  pixels  in
        the requested range is written into this parameter.
    
    (ymax= ) [integer]
        Location  (y-direction)  of  the  maximum value of the pixels in
        the requested range is written into this parameter.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean])
        Flag specifying whether or not a  pre-existing  file  with   the
        same  name  as that  requested as the output file from this task
        will be overwritten.
        
        
EXAMPLES 
    
    1. To compute the statistics for  the  input  image  file  file.img,
    including all the pixels,
    
       prompt>       fimgstat      infile=file.img      threshlo=I/INDEF     
    threshup=I/INDEF
    
    2. To compute the statistics for  the  input  image  file  file.img,
    with  lower  pixel  value=lo and upper pixel value=up, and write the
    output to file.out
    
       prompt>   fimgstat   infile=file.img   threshlo=lo    threshup=up  
    outfile=file.out
