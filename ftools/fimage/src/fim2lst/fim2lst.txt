NAME
    fim2lst   --  Create  an  output  file  containing  a  list  of  the 
    coordinates and value of the pixels in an input FITS image.
    
    
USAGE
    fim2lst infile outfil
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task will read data from a FITS image file (1-d,  2-d  or  3-d)
    and  write  the  X  (Y, Z) coordinates and the data value of all the
    non-zero pixels to an output FITS file. Zero-valued  pixels  can  be
    included  by setting the copyall parameter. Now supports writing the
    world coordinate column(s) for 1- and 2-d images.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        Name of the input FITS image or image extension.
    
    outfil [filename]
        The name of the FITS  file  to  which  the  list  of  pixels  is
        written.
    
    (x = X) [string]
        Name  for  the  column  in  the  output  file  containing  the X
        coordinate of the pixel.
    
    (xcoord = XCOORD) [string]
        Name for the column containing the pixel X world coordinate.
    
    (y = Y) [string]
        Name for  the  column  in  the  output  file  containing  the  Y
        coordinate of the pixel.
    
    (ycoord = YCOORD) [string]
        Name for the column containing the pixel Y world coordinate.
    
    (z = Z) [string]
        Name  for  the  column  in  the  output  file  containing  the Z
        coordinate of the pixel.
    
    (value = VALUE) [string]
        Name of the column in the output file containing  the  value  of
        the pixel.
    
    (extnam = "") [string]
        Value  to  be  written  to  the  EXTNAME  keyword  in the output
        extension.
    
    (copyall = no) [boolean]
        If set, this will force fim2lst to copy  all  pixels,  including
        zeros.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        If  true,  an  existing  output  file  of  the same name will be
        overwritten.
    
    
    
EXAMPLES 
    1.  Construct a list of non-zero pixels in the input image.fits file
    and write the list to the output file called utfile.fits.
    
        ft> fim2lst image.fits outfile.fits
    
    
NOTES:
    FIM2LST  uses  dynamic  memory  to  read  in the entire image at one
    time.  If the requested image is larger than  the  available  system
    memory, an error will be reported
