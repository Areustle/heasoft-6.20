NAME
    fregcon  --  region  file  converter from one instrument/detector to
    another
    
    
USAGE
    fregcon infil1 infil2 regfile outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task converts a selected region from one observation to another
    either  based  on  the  reference values contained in the FITS files
    for the  two  observations  or  on  a  single  multiplicative  scale
    factor.   The  list  of selected regions (up to 40) are specified in
    the regionfile (regfile). The region file is  produced  by  SAOimage
    or SAOtng. Possible shapes for the regions are the following:
    
    *  circle
    *  box
    *  ellipse
    *  point
    *  polygon (up to 40 points)
    *  annulus
    
    If the factor parameter is specified then the infil1 and infil2 are not
    required and the regions will be modified by scaling the image size by
    the value of the factor parameter.
    
    The following reference keyword values read from the two input FITS files.
    They are passed to the ftwldp.f and xy2sky.f routines which compute the new
    coordinates.
    
    CRPIX1  =  X axis reference pixel
    CRPIX2  =  Y axis reference pixel
    CRVAL1  =  Sky coord of X ref pixel (degrees)
    CRVAL2  =  Sky coord of Y ref pixel (degrees)
    CDELT1  =  X axis increment (degrees)
    CDELT2  =  Y axis increment (degrees)
    CROTA2  =  ROLL angle
    CTYPE1  =  RA projection 
    CTYPE2  =  DEC projection
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infil1 [file name]
        The first input FITS file and extension number.
    
    infil2 [file name]
        The second input FITS file and extension number.
    
    regfile [file name]
        The region file containing old region file data.
    
    outfile [file name]
        The output file containing new region file data.
    
    factor [real]
        The  factor  by which to increase the image scale for the region
        files. ie all region dimensions are multiplied by the  value  of
        factor  and  if  the  positions are in pixels then these too are
        multiplied.
