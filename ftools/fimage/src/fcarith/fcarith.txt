NAME
    fcarith -- Read an input FITS  file  and  a  constant,  perform  the
    requested  arithmetic  operations ADD, SUB, MUL or DIV and write the
    output to a FITS file.
    
    
USAGE
    fcarith INFILE CONST OUTFIL OPS
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task will read an images from  a  FITS  files  and  a  constant
    input  by  the user, perform any one of the operations ADD, SUB, MUL
    and DIV (or +, -, * or /), between each element  of  the  FITS  file
    and  the  input  constant  and  write the output into an output FITS
    file.  (The * must be quoted to prevent  expansion  by  the  shell.)
    The arithmetic operation can take place on images with n-dimensions.
    Note that scaling is NOT done in the output file, so care should  be
    taken  in  setting  datatype  to avoid overflow and integer division
    problems.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
    The name and extension of the input FITS file image.
    
    const [real]
    The value of the constant to be used in the calculation.
    
    outfil [filename]
    The name of the output FITS file.  The image will be  place  in  the
    primary  array.   If  preceeded by a !, an existing file of the same
    name will be overwritten.
    
    ops [string]
    The requested type of calculation.  The  value  can  be  either  the
    words  ADD,  SUB,  MUL or DIV or the mathematical symbols +, -, * or
    /.  Extra characters on the words (MULT for  example)  are  ignored.
    The * must be quoted to prevent expansion by the shell.
    
    (datatype) [string]
    The  datatype (or bits/pixel) of the output image.  If blank or "-",
    defaults are to the bitpix of the input  image.   Acceptable  inputs
    are        (b,8),       (i,short,16),       (j,integer,int,long,32),      
    (r,f,e,real,float,-32) and (d,double,-64).

    (overflow = no) [boolean]
    Whether to ignore the overflow and underflow in the output file.
    If true, the overflow and underflow elements of the output image
    array will be ignored and replaced with the maximum and minimum
    of the corresponding data type. If false, these elements will throw
    an error and terminate the program. This option is only relevant
    for byte, short and integer images.

    (copyprime = yes) [boolean]
    Whether to copy keywords from the primary array of infile1.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
    If true, an existing file with the same name as the output file will
    be overwritten.
    
    
EXAMPLES 
    1.   Read  the  image  values  in  the  primary  array of INFILE and
        divide all of the values  by  10.   Write  the  resultant  image
        into the primary array of the output FITS file OUTFIL.

    2. Same example using DIV
