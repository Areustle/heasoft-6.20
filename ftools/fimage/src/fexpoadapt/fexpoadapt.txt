NAME
    fexpoadapt -- Adaptively smooth an image and an exposure map together.
    
    
USAGE
    fexpoadapt image expomap smooth mincounts [minexpo]

    
DESCRIPTION
    This is a boxcar  smoothing program  that works on  an image and the
    exposure  map  associated  with  it  simultaneously.  A  pixel  with
    exposure less than 'minexpo'  (typically 0)  is set to 0; otherwise,
    this  accumulates values  from surrounding  pixels until  it has  at
    least 'mincounts' counts.  The total is then divided by the total of
    exposures accumulated from the same pixels.
    
PARAMETERS
    
    image [filename]
        Name of input image file to be smoothed.
    expomap [filename]
        Name of exposure map file to be used with the above.
    smooth [filename]
        Name of output image file (smoothed and exposure corrected).
    mincounts = 50 [real]
        The minimum number of counts per cell.
    minexpo [real] (hidden)
        The minimum exposure time below which a pixel is rejected.
        It can be used, e.g., to exclude low-exposure regions at the
        edge of the detctor from the output.
        
        
EXAMPLES
    1. Smooth  gis.img,  with  associated  exposure  map  gis.expo,  to
       contain a minimum of 100 counts per cell; output the result into
       gis_smooth.img

	    ex>fexpoadapt gis.img gis.expo gis_smooth.img 100
