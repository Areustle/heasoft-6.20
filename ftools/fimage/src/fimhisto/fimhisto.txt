NAME
    fimhisto - Creates a histogram of the image extension.
    
    
    
USAGE
    fimhisto infile outfile range binsize <nbins>
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    FIMHISTO  creates  a  histogram  of  an  image extension within user
    defined  minimum  and  maximum  values(range)  inclusive.  If  these 
    values  are  INDEF,  the  minimum  and maximum values are calculated
    from the input image array. Options are  provided  to  input  either
    binsize  OR  the  no.  of  bins.   In  case,  if binsize<=0, user is
    prompted for the no. of bins parameter for the histogram.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [string]
        The name of the input image file to create histogram for.
    
    outfile [string]
        The name of output file.
    
    range[string]
        The minimum and maximum value,  inclusive,  for  the  histogram.
        The  values  are  to  be  separated  by 'comma'. For example, if
        minimum value is 2.0 and maximum is to be  calculated  from  the
        data, then user input looks like (2.0,INDEF)
    
    binsize[float]
        Size  of  each  bin user wants to be.  This value is in terms of
        the values of the pixels. If binsize value is <=0, then user  is
        asked for the no. of bins.
    
    nbins[integer]
        No.  of bins for histogram. Binsize will be calculated depending
        on this parameter.  This parameter is prompted for if  and  only
        if  user  input  for binsize is <= 0.  Thus if an user wants no.
        of bins as input instead  of  binsize,  then  one  should  input
        binsize=0  or  any  -ve  no.  so  then  user  is asked for nbins
        parameter.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean])
        Flag specifying whether or not a  pre-existing  file  with   the
        same  name  as that  requested as the output file from this task
        will be overwritten.
        
        
EXAMPLES
    
    1. To calculate histogram of an image extension,  with  minimum  and
    maximum  values  to  be  calculated  from  the  input  array,  range 
    parameter need to be INDEF and with nbins=20, then
    
    prompt> fimhisto infile outfile range=INDEF,INDEF binsize=0 nbins=20
    
    or, minimum value =2.0 and maximum to be calculated from input array and
        with binsize=3, then
    
    prompt> fimhisto infile outfile range=2.0,INDEF binsize=3
