NAME
    fmaskfilt --  Filter an event list based on an input mask image
    
    
USAGE
    fmaskfilt infile maskfile outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
    This task will create a new event list containing only events  which
    fall  in  the  include  regions (any value not equal to zero) of the
    input mask file.  Since  the  mask  file  is  in  pixel  coordinates
    rather  than  the  coordinates  of  the  events file, FMASKFILT will
    translate the values using the keywords: CRVALn, CRPIXn and  CDELTn,
    as  well  as  the  names of the columns corresponding to the axes of
    the mask (XCOLNAME and YCOLNAME).   The  task  F2DHISTO  writes  the
    correct  values  of  these keywords in the primary array header.  If
    keywords  are  missing  from  the  primary  header  of   the   input 
    imagefile,   they   can   be   supplied  to  this  task  via  hidden 
    parameters.   The  default  hidden  parameters  correspond   to   no 
    transformation.   If  the keywords are present in the mask file, the
    hidden parameter values are ignored.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        The name and extension of the input events file to be filtered.
    
    maskfile [filename]
        The name and extension of the file  containing  the  mask.   The
        default extension is the primary array.
    
    outfile [filename] 
        The name of the output filtered events file.
    
    (xcolname="X") [string]
        The name of the column corresponding to the X axis of the mask.
    
    (ycolname = "Y") [string]
        The name of the column corresponding to the Y axis of the mask.
    
    (crval1 = 1.) [real]
        Coordinate value of X reference pixel
    
    (crval2 = 1.) [real]
        Coordinate value of Y reference pixel
    
    (crpix1 = 1.) [real]
        X axis reference pixel number
    
    (crpix2 = 1.) [real]
        Y axis reference pixel number
    
    (cdelt1 = 1.) [real]
        X axis coordinate increment
    
    (cdelt2 = 1.) [real]
        Y axis coordinate increment
    
    (inverse = no) [boolean]
        Whether  to  use  the  mask  as an inverse filter,i.e., take the
        events  whose  positions  corresponding  to  the  zero   pixels. 
        filtered file.
    
    (copyprime = yes) [boolean]
        Whether  to  copy  the primary header from the input events file
        to the output filtered file.
    
    (copyall = yes) [boolean]
        Whether to copy all other extension from the input  events  file
        to the output filtered file.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        If  true,  an  existing  output  file  of  the same name will be
        overwritten.
        
        
        
EXAMPLES
    1.  Filter in event file allevent.fits with the mask in the  primary
    array of mask.fits, and write it to the file filtered.fits
