NAME
    fimconcat  -- Take 2 images from two input files and place them side
    by side in a single array in the output file.
    
    
USAGE
    fimconcat infil1 infil2 outfil orient
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Takes two input  FITS  files  containing  images  in  their  primary
    arrays  and  places the images side by side (either left-to-right or
    bottom-to-top) in the primary image array of the output file.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infil1 [filename]
        The first input FITS file name. This will be on the left  or  on
        the  bottom  of  the output image (assuming lower left corner of
        image is first pixel).
    
    infil2 [filename]
        The second input FITS file name. This will be on the right or on
        the  top  of  the  output  image  (assuming lower left corner of
        image is first pixel).
    
    outfil [filename]
        The output FITS file name.  The new image will be in the primary
        data array.
    
    orient [string]
        LR for left to right concatenation of the images.  BT for bottom
        to top concatenation.
    
    (datatype="E") [character]
        The data type for the resulting concatenated image. The letter B
        or  b  represents  byte,  the  letter  I  or i represents  short
        integer, the letter J or j represents integer, the letter E or e
        represents  single  precision  reals  and  the  letter  D  or  d 
        represents double  precision reals.
    
    (copyprime=yes) [boolean]
        Whether to copy all additional keywords from the  primary  array
        of the input file to the primary array of the output file.
    
    
EXAMPLES 
    To  put  the  images  in image1.fits and image2.fits side by side in
    2image.fits using 4 byte integers in the output file
    
    ft>fimconcat image1.fits image2.fits 2image.fits LR datatype=J
    
    
    
NOTES
    The images do not have to be the same size; fimconcat will pad  with
    blank pixels to make them fit into a rectangular output image.
