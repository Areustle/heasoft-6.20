Viewport Configuration Files (.vpc)

The files with the extension .vpc are viewport configuration files.
Each line corresponds to a viewport definition in units of normalized
device coordinates (NDC).  These are the coordinates where the 
horizontal direction of the PGPLOT device is normalized to go from 0 to 1
from left to right and in the vertical direction, normalized to go
from 0 to 1 from bottom to top.

Each line defines a viewport as follows:

left_edge right_edge bottom_edge top_edge
  (v1)       (v2)       (v3)       (v4)

    v1   v2
     !    !
 v4->|----|<-v4
     |VIEW|
     |PORT|
 v3->|----|<-v3
     ^    ^
    v1   v2


For example, in 2x1.vpc:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
!
!  Viewport configuration file (2x1)
!
!        -------------
!        |     |     |
!        |  1  |  2  |
!        |     |     |
!        -------------
!
!v1  v2  v3  v4
!-- --- --- ---
0.1 0.5 0.2 0.8
0.5 0.9 0.2 0.8
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To start using a VPC (e.g. 2x1.vpc):

VIEWPORT 2x1

Note: XIMAGE will look for the given file in the local directory
      first.  If one is not found, it will append '.vpc' and look
      in the distribution's "files" directory.

To see which viewport number will be displayed next, use
the SHOW command.  The following line shows the viewport
configuration file currently in use:

  Viewport                  : 2x1 - 1

The number following the dash (-) represents the viewport number
in the file.  If you DISPLAY or CONTOUR at this point the image
will be displayed in square #1 represented in the ASCII grid above.
Using SHOW again:

  Viewport                  : 2x1 - 2

The next DISPLAY or CONTOUR will plot the image in square #2,
leaving the image already plotted in #1 on the device.  

Note: The OVERLAY qualifier should be omitted unless you wish the
CONTOUR to be overlayed on top of the currently displayed image,
rather than in the next viewport.

When the last viewport in the the configuration is reached, a
new PGPLOT device page will be opened and the numbering will
begin again at 1.
