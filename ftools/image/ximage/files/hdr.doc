Header Template Files (.hdr)

The files with the extension .hdr have the following format for each 
(uncommented) line:

   OUTKEYWD = *INKEYWD / COMMENT

The OUTKEYWD and COMMENT values are used without modification 
in XIMAGE's FITS writer, while the *INKEYWD field contains information 
on what type the keyword value is and which header key as defined 
in the header.inc is to be accessed.

The = and / are not required, with one or more spaces being sufficient
to separate the values.  Also, lines beginning with a # or ! are ignored.

In *INKEYWD

  * is a symbol representing the keyword type
    [ !,I,i = integer ]
    [ $,S,s = string ]
    [ #,D,d = real ]
    [ ? = XIMAGE figures out the type for you ] 

  INKEYWD is the internal header keyword whose value is to be written

    - If INKEYWD is left blank, the value for OUTKEYWD is
      assumed when looking up the header value.  In this case,
      the ? may be omitted.
    - Currently defined keywords are documented in all.hdr

  INKEYWD can also be a quoted value which is independent of internal
  header values by preceding the the value with a \ character.  If no
  type character is given, string is assumed.  The ? is not a valid
  type for a quoted value.  If is is necessary to quote a string, the
  \ or type indicator must be the first character inside the quotes
  (e.g. '$\text phrase' or '\text phrase').

Another option allows for calculating a new keyword based on known
keywords.  The expression must be enclosed in parentheses and quoting is
recommended (otherwise a division will be interpretted as a FITS
comment).  Keywords must be capitalized and any function available to
the Tcl expr command is valid as long as it is lowercase.  Care must 
be taken when integers are being divided as Tcl will assume integer 
division and give unexpected results (e.g. 1/2 = 0, 1.0/2 = 0.5).

For example:

OBJECT  = $        / Field identification
CDELT1  = D        / Pixel size in x
CDELT2             / Pixel size in y
REBIN_X = !ZMX     / Rebin in the x direction
REBIN_Y = ?ZMX     / Rebin in the y direction
CREATOR = $\XIMAGE / Program which created this file
LTV1    = '(1.0/ZMX)' / Calculate IRAF-compatible scaling (x)
LTV2    = '(1.0/ZMY)' / Calculate IRAF-compatible scaling (y)

With internal values:

OBJECT  = 'PLEIADES CENTER'
CDELT1  = -1.111111111015E-03
CDELT2  =  1.111111111015E-03
ZMX     = 8
ZMY     = 8

Yields FITS header lines like the following:

OBJECT  = 'PLEIADES CENTER'    / Field identification
CDELT1  = -1.111111111015E-03  / Pixel size in x
CDELT2  =  1.111111111015E-03  / Pixel size in y
REBIN_X = 8                    / Rebin in the x direction
REBIN_Y = 8                    / Rebin in the y direction
CREATOR = 'XIMAGE  '           / Program which created this file
LTV1    = 0.125                / Calculate IRAF-compatible scaling (x)
LTV2    = 0.125                / Calculate IRAF-compatible scaling (y)
