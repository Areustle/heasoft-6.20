Color Table Files (.tab)

The files with the extension .tab are color table files, for use
with the CCT command.  Each line defines a color, with the first
column being the red component, the second being the green, and
the third being the blue.

Note: The number of colors need not match the number of levels
      being calculated for the image, as intermediate colors will
      be calculated or extra colors omitted to match the needed number.

Usage example (to set monoblue1 as the default color table): 

CCT/SET monoblue1

The file, color_tables.dat, in the "manager" directory refers to 
these files.  The order that they are listed in that file 
corresponds to the order they will be used when running the 
CCT/LOOP command.
