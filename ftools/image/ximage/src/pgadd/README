                     PG_ADDITION Files and Library

These are the files necessary to construct the PG_ADDITION library.  

Build Files
-----------

mkxpg: 

	Generates a set of modified PGPLOT routines from PGPLOT source.  The
	PGPLOT_SRC environmental variable must be set to the location of
	PGPLOT's source tree (Note, don't set this to the directory named
	src.  That directory should be inside $PGPLOT_SRC)  The script uses
	the current setting for $XANADU to determine the location of the
	created files.  The following files are created by executing mkxpg:

	pgplot.inc:  Copy of PGPLOT's general include file
	grpckg1.inc: Copy of PGPLOT's low-level include file
	xpgsitf.f :  Version of PGPLOT's pgsitf.f which allows a flag for
	               imaging by levels
	xpgimag.f :  Version of PGPLOT's pgimag.f which calls xgrimg0
	xgrimg0.f :  Version of PGPLOT's grimg0.f which calls xgrimg1 and 
	               xgrimg2
	xgrimg1.f :  Version of PGPLOT's grimg1.f which uses levels to 
	               plot image
	xgrimg2.f :  Version of PGPLOT's grimg2.f which uses levels to
	               plot image

makefile.xan:  Library maker (utilized by xmake)


Setting Levels
--------------

level.inc: Common block which contains level table (used by xgrimg1&2).  

pggetlevs.f: Returns the level table values from level.inc

pgsetlevs.f: Assigns level table values in level.inc.

location.f : Finds location of input value in levels array (in xgrimg1&2)


Colors
------

pg_setcir.f: Assigns color index range for XPGIMAG 

pgfillbg.f: Sets colors to the first image color


Device properties
-----------------

isdisplay: Returns whether device is open

ismouse: Returns whether you can interact with device using mouse

ishardcopy: Returns whether device is hardcopy

Misc.
-----

ndc2wor.f : Converts normalized device to world coordinates
