This code was imported from ESIS (ESA) used a CDS libraries 
The code is a great cut and paste and need a good clean up
for future mantaince. 

Later modifications to grid denoted by (*)

axisn       plot labels 
            (include used coast,axisn,projec,pi,greg)
            Renamed gridlab 
            *reduced includes to gridlab (formerly axisn) and greg

axisx       convertion coordinates 
            NOTE NEVER used
            *deleted

cubspl4     spline interpolation 

decode      contains 3 subroutine to manipulate the ra dec values
            sexag,decode,cflab, entry(cflab1)
            NOTE  This code can be re-written. decode and cflab are only 
                  used internally in sexag 
            *deleted

dezimal.f   convert deg mm ss in deg 
            NOTE never used 
            *deleted

difsys4.f   integrate a differential equation

draw.f      contains 6 routine and 1 entry point 
            relocate,grelocate,draw,grpoly,grclip_x,cross,entry(gdraw)
            (include used fudge greg)
            NOTE grpoly and cross never used 
            *draw/relocate are now just wrappers to simplifiy meridien calls 
            *core drawing routine is gdraw, rad2det converts between
              special radian coord system and detector coordinate system
            *grelocate, grpoly, cross deleted.

gagout.f    write on the screen
            NOTE to be substitute by xwrite
            *deleted

galac.f     contains 4 routines and 1 entry point
            galac,equ_gal,gal_equ,prelo,entry(pdraw)
            NOTE equ_gal,gal_equ could be substitute by sla lib
            (include used greg)
            *split into separate files. prelo, pdraw deleted.
            *equ_gal/gal_equ not replaced with ctg/gtc because
              of units complication (radians)

grclip2_x.f check if points is within the drawn box
            NOTE maybe can be substitute by a pgplot routine
            (include used greg)           
            *renamed gridx 

gridmp.f    contains 3 routines
            gridmp meridien parallele
            (include used pi, projec, coast,axisn,fudge,greg) 
            *routines split into different files

grids.f     set up variable and drawing box
            (include used pi, projec, coast,xpar, greg, ximage_grid) 
            NOTE xpar include is not used  
gridin.f    ximage par file 
grid.f      ximage interface to grid
            *merged all these into grid.f
           
grline.f    plot line 
            (include greg and ximage_grid)
            NOTE can be abolished after cleaning the common  
            *deleted

lenc.f      retrun the last not leading black 
            NOTE can be substituted 
            *deleted

plcurv.f    contains 4 routines 
            plcurv, plcurv4, curvil, curfun
            (include curcom.inc used only here)
            *plcurv4 deleted, others split into files

projec.f    contains 4 routines and 2 functions
            rel_to_abs, abs_to_rel, setpro, setrem
            f(arcsin), f(arccos)
            (include projec, pi, greg) 
            *split into files.  rel_to_abs/abs_to_rel can
            *be replaced when we support WCS

prolev.f    lever_x define the declination according teo the 
            latitute (include pi)
            NOTE can be clean up and pi deleted 
            *renamed file lever_x.f

round.f     round the input value 
            NOTE can be substitute 
            *renamed gridrnd (calculates "nice numbers" rather than
             a straight round. not easily substituted)

sexagesi.f  write ra and dec in several string formats
            NOTE can be substituted 
            *deleted

ustoin.f   contains 4 routines, 2 entry, 1 function
             gr8_phys_user, gr4_phys_user, us8_to_int, us4_to_int
             entry(gr8_user_phys), entry(gr4_user_phys) 
             (WHERE are THESE defined....)
             f(gr_clip) 
            (include greg.inc)
            NOTE gr_clip is never used 
            *deleted
