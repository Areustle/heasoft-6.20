DESCRIPTION
        ASCAEFFMAP   generates   an   ASCA  detector  efficiency  map in
        detector coordinates for the energy band specified  by  <pha_lo>
        and <pha_hi> of the input spectral file.
    
        The  input spectral file is used as the weights to calculate the
        energy  averaged  efficiency  map.  The  weights  used  for  the 
    calculation,      as  well  as the input spectrum, is written in the
    first extension of     the output file.
    
        The output efficiency map may be  used  to  correct  vignetting,
    GIS      grid  structure,  GIS  efficiency  non-uniformity, and gaps
    between SIS     chips.
    
        The output efficiency map can be also used as an  input  of  the
    ftool      'ascaexpo'  (to  specify as the 'instfile' parameter), to
    make exposure     maps with vignetting and  instrumental  efficiency
    corrections.

    pha_lo [real]
                The  lower boundary of the pulse-height channels to use.
                The channel number refers to the channel after grouping.
    
    pha_hi [real]
                The upper boundary of the pulse-height channels to  use.

                Output file name.
    
    (rmffile [string])
                Name  of the input RMF file. If 'CALDB', the calibration
        database          is  searched  for  an  appropriate  file.  The 
        default is 'CALDB'.
    
    (wmapfile [string])
                The   name of the input WMAP file. If 'default', WMAP is
        taken         from the input spectral file.
    
    (teldef [string])
                The name of  the  telescope  definition  file   to   get
        chip   image          (SIS  only).  If  'CALDB', the calibration
        database  is  searched          for  an  appropriate  file.   If 
        'AUTO',  the calibration database is         searched if present
        otherwise the appropriate file  in  the  ftools          refdata
        directory is used. The default is 'AUTO'.
    
    
    (clobber [bool])
                If  clobber=yes, the output file overwrites any existing
        file of         the same name. The default is yes.
    
    (xrteff [bool])
                If xrteff=yes, multiply by the XRT effective  area.  The
        default         is yes.
    
    (gispsf [bool])
                If  gispsf=yes,  convolve  with  the  GIS  point  spread 
        function.          The default is yes.
    
    (bethick [string])
                The filename for the GIS Be thickness detector  map.  If
        'CALDB',          the  calibration  database  is searched for an
        appropriate file.          If 'AUTO', the  calibration  database
        is  searched  if  present         otherwise the appropriate file
        in the ftools refdata directory         is used. The default  is
        'AUTO'.
    
    (grid [string])
                The  filename for the GIS grid detector map. If 'CALDB',
        the         calibration database is searched for an  appropriate
        file.  If          'AUTO',  the calibration database is searched
        if present otherwise         the appropriate file in the  ftools
        refdata directory is used.          The default is 'AUTO'.
    
    (xrtrsp [string])
                The  path  to  the  XRT effective area file. If 'CALDB',
        the         calibration database is searched for an  appropriate
        file.  If          'AUTO',  the calibration database is searched
        if present otherwise         the appropriate file in the  ftools
        refdata directory is used.          The default is 'AUTO'.
        
        
EXAMPLES
        1)  Produce  an efficiency map file 'eff.fits' from the spectral
           file 'gis2pha.fits' for  chips  0  and  1  for  the  spectral
    channels         10-20.   The  response  matrix  is  found  from the
    calibration database.

NOTE
        The output efficiency map   is   made  in  detector  coordinate.
        To   make   an  exposure  map  in the sky coordinate, 'ascaexpo'
        should be used.
    
    
BUGS
        Since  ascaeffmap  calculates  the  efficiency  map   for   each 
        grouped  spectral  bin  between  the lower and upper boundaries,
        it can take an extremely long time to  finish  when  the  entire
    energy      band  is  specified.  It  is  recommended  that a narrow
    spectral band     be specified or  the  spectral  bins  be  coarsely
    grouped.
