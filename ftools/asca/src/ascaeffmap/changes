run unprotoize on *.c

Throughout, changed:

<cfortran.h>    to "cfortran.h"
<jcoord.h>      to "jcoord.h"
<cfitsio.h>     to "cfitsio.h"
<rmf.h>         to "rmf.h"
<atFunctions.h> to "atFunctions.h"

created make.com, mkpkg and ascaeffmap.txt

#ifdef vms
#  define M_PI           3.14159265358979323846
#  define get_gis_eff get_gis_eff_
#  define gis_psf gis_psf_
#endif vms

add to jcoord.h:

#ifdef vms
#  define jc_sis_detch2raw jc_sis_detch2raw_
#  define jc_init jc_init_
#endif vms

add to gisresf.c

#ifdef vms
#  define get_gis_eff get_gis_eff_
#  define gis_psf gis_psf_

#  define get_sis_eff get_sis_eff_
#endif vms

CFORTRAN problems:
some CFORTRAN calls were not passing variable correctly when they were
entered as constants in the function call.  dummy variables were put
in and solved the problem.  This is strange behavior and may signal
an as yet undiscovered problem elsewhere.

remove XANADU dependancies:

lenact -> clenact
xwrite -> fcecho
getlun -> ftgiou
frelun -> ftfiou

remove SF format input file:
   comment out sections in rdsinf.f and rddtrt.f.  Do not compile rddtsf.f
