DESCRIPTION

    ATTITUDE is a utility program used in conjunction with ASCALIN to 
    compute a common aspect point for all four detector images. 

    ATTITUDE reads an ASCA attitude file and displays pointing info-
    mation. Key pointing information is also written out to the 
    parameter file.
    
    There are 10 sky pointing direction to consider with ASCA aspecting:

    (1)   The satellite direction defined as the Z-axis or boresight, 

    (2-5) The origin of each detector image in sky coordinates, which is 
          slightly difference to the Z-axis and to each other, 

    (6-9) The optical axis of each of the four telescopes which also points 
          in individual direction, and, 

    (10)  A conveniently defined 'mean detector' or 'operation' pointing, 
          which is approximately the mean of the detector origins.
    
    ATTITUDE computes (1), (10), while (2-5) and (6-9) are determined in
    addition by ASCALIN for each instrument over the Science File times.
    
    ATTITUDE gives the mean satellite boresight as a set of Euler angle
    using the (Z-X-Z) definition, displayed in a form compatible with
    the ASCA Observation Reports, as well as the angles these axes make 
    with respect to the Sun. The Euler angles and their Solar angles are
    particularly useful since the Y-axis is perpendicular to the solar
    panel, the X-axis is related to the roll angle, and the Z-axis defines
    the satellite boresight.
    
    ATTITUDE also gives the mean detector pointing (RA/DEC/ROLL), ranges
    and RMS errors, the mean Sun location, as well as the mean annual 
    aberration correction.
    
    ATTITUDE also compute the mean offset from the average file pointing
    to a sky reference point (mean tangent plane offset in arcmin). The 
    sky reference point may be given as an input value RA/DEC, (USER) or
    the computed file average itself will be used (ATT), in which case no
    additional input is necessary.
    
    The following information is displayed:
    
    1) Full path name of input file (truncated to to 55 characters).
    
    2) The attitude file start and stop times as given in the file header.

    3) The start and stop time of the data file to be processed.
    
    4) The time value of the first and last record used from this
       attitude file.
    
    5) The total time interval spanned by this file.
    
    6) The Mean boresight Euler angles averaged over the the attitude file.
    
    7) a) The position of the Sun computed at the half way time (degrees), 
       b) The Annual Aberration angle correction at this time (arcsec).
    
    8) The mean satellite X-Y-Z axis pointing and the angles they makes
       with the Sun (degrees).
    
    9) The file average, minimum, maximum, and sigma for the RA, DEC, and 
       ROLL angle, and the linear offset along  the  focal  plane. For
       ATTITUDE, the averages are determines using the mean mis-alignment
       matrix; for ASCALIN, the averages are determines using the instrument
       specific ones. The offset is just the mean linear tangent plane 
       deviation from the aspect RA/DEC during the file time.
    
    The following information is written back into ATTITUDE's parameter
    file. The valid flag is set to 'no' at the beginning of the run and
    reset to 'yes' following successful completion:
    
    (valid = yes)           Is this data valid?
