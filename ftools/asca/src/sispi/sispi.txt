NAME
    sispi -- Fill PI column of ASCA SIS BRIGHT or BRIGHT2 mode data
    
    
USAGE
    
    sispi datafile calfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task is written specifically to  process  data  from  the  ASCA
    X-ray  satellite  and  requires  SIS  BRIGHT or BRIGHT2 mode science
    file(s) as input.  The Pulse Invariant (PI) column, which exists  in
    these  files  but  not  necessarily  populated,  will  be filled, or
    updated, by this task using a SIS gain/CTI history file;  PH  to  PI
    conversion  formula,  the  history file format and the actual values
    have been/are to be supplied by the ASCA SIS team.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    datafile [file name]
        The ASCA science  FITS  file  and  extension  to  be  processed.
        Multiple  files  can  be  processed  if given the name of a file
        containing a list of file  names,  preceded  by  an  '@'  symbol
        (e.g., @list).
    
    calfile [file name]
        The  SIS  gain/CTI  history file name.  If the site and the user
        process has the calibration database  set-up,  entering  'CALDB'
        here  will  ensure  the latest version will be used: this is the
        preferred access method.  'FTOOLS' is a  valid  anwer  for  now,
        and  will  use  the pre-specified file name in the refdata area.
        'DEFAULT'  means   the   value   of   the   defSISfile   keyword 
        (compatibility  with  ascalin), or the filename can be specified
        explicitly here.  The 'AUTO' option, for use  in  scripts,  will
        try CALDB then FTOOLS then defSISfile until it succeeds.
    
    rawxcol [string] (hidden parameters)
        The name of the RAWX column.
    
    rawycol [string] (hidden parameters)
        The name of the RAWY column.
    
    phacol [string] (hidden parameters)
        The name of the PHA column.
    
    gradecol [string] (hidden parameters)
        The name of the GRADE column.
    
    idcol [string] (hidden parameters)
        The name of the CCD ID column.
    
    picol [string] (hidden parameters)
        The name of the PI column.
    
    gainnom [real] (hidden parameters)
        The  nominal gain value to be used for the PI; negative value is
        default, in which case the value found in the gain history  file
        will  be  used.  Positive values will be taken as eV/channel and
        will supercede the history file value.
    
    offset [real] (hidden parameters)
        This parameter allows users to specify an offset (in keV) in the
        channel-energy relashipnship.
    
    launch [boolean] (hidden parameters)
        Whether  to  use  the  time  dependent  gain/CTI values from the
        calibration file (no)  or  simply  use  the  nominal  values  at
        launch (yes)
    
    verbose [logical] (hidden parameters)
        The verbose flag: run time information updates.
    
    history [logical] (hidden parameters)
        The  history  flag  -  currently this parameter does nothing, as
        there are no optional history keywords that SISPI adds.
    
    defSISfile [string] (hidden parameters)
        An alternative method  of  specifying  the  calfile,  used  when
        DEFAULT was used as calfile name.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    
    sispi s0_clean.evt /ftools/DEC/release/refdata/sisph2pi.fits
        
        To  fill  the  PI  column  of  previously  processed  SIS BRIGHT
        science file, where "s0_clean.evt" is the science file.
    
    sispi gainnom=3.68 offset=-0.024 verbose=yes
        
        These optional keywords allow the user to incorporate results of
        gain/offset  fitting  in  XSPEC.   This is a powerful procedure,
        and can be dangerous; please use with caution.   The  energy  vs
        channel  calibration  incorporated  in sispi is imperfect, and a
        slight adjustment in gain and offset  may  produce  an  improved
        fit.   Since  gain  command  in XSPEC is an approximation, it is
        adviseable to feed the results back to  the  spectrum  file,  by
        using  sispi.   To  do  this,  use these keywords with a gainnom
        value of 3.65 * xspec_gain, and an offset as derived by XSPEC.
    
    
BUGS
    
    Refdata access routine used in the AUTO option will send an error
        message to stderr, if the expected  file  is  not  found,  which
        will  terminate  XSELECT  and  ascascreen  (and  probably  other 
        scripts).
    
    The content of the XFORMTYP keyword is not currently checked.
