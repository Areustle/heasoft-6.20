NAME
    aspect -- Computes the euler angles of the best aspect point.
    
    
USAGE
    aspect infile outfile verbose_parameter
    
    
DESCRIPTION
     The  ASPECT  task  reads euler angles from an output file generated
    by the ftool  ATTITUDE and computes the euler angles  for  the  best
    aspect  point.   First, it bins the first two Euler angles into 0.01
    degree bins and  then selects  the set of four adjacent  bins  which
    contains  the largest number  of points. The mean of all three Euler
    angles is calculated for the points  that fall  within  these  bins.
     The  output  is  the  three Euler angles describing the attitude of
    the x-y-z  axes of the spacecraft. Note that this is different  from
    the  mean  pointing   of  the  XRT  and  from  the  poining  of each
    individual  telescope.  See  the    attitude   and   ascalin   FTOOL 
    documentation for more details.
    
     The  evaluated  values of the three Euler angles are written to the
    parameter  file as well as to the  defined  output  file.    If  the
    "VERBOSE"  option  is set to "y", then a list of bin counts and sums
     for each euler angle is printed. The default value for  VERBOSE  is
    "n".
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The  input  file (generated by ATTITUDE).
    
    outfile [file name]
        The output file containing the three Euler angles.
    
    verbose [string]
         If  the  "VERBOSE"  option  is  set  to "y", then a list of bin
        counts and sums  for each euler angle is  printed.  The  default
        value for VERBOSE is "n".
