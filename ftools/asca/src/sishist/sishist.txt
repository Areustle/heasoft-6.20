NAME
    sishist - creates histograms of SIS events/pixel for graphing
    
    
USAGE
    sishist infile outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  takes  an  input  SIS  BRIGHT  or  BRIGHT2 mode file and
    generates a histogram of the number of pixels which have at least  n
    events  in  the  input  file.   That is, the first row of the output
    column contains the number of pixels which had at least  one  event,
    the  second row contains the number of pixels which had at least two
    events in the input file, etc.  up to a  maximum  number,  currently
    set   to  100.   Separate  columns  are  generated  for  the  entire 
    detector, and for each separate chip.  If desired, a poissonian  fit
    is also output.  This task generates these values as a graphical aid
    in the elimination of  flickering  pixels  and  should  be  used  in
    conjunction with SISCLEAN.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The  name of the input SIS BRIGHT or BRIGHT2 mode FITS file (and
        extension number in square brackets or separated by  a  +).    A
        list  of  files  may  be entered either as the parameter or in a
        file specified by @filename.
    
    outfile [file name]
        The name of the output FITS file.
    
    (rawxname = RAWX) [string]
        The name of the RAWX column.
    
    (rawyname = RAWY) [string]
        The name of the RAWY column.
    
    (ccdidname = CCDID) [string]
        The name of the CCDID column.
    
    (fit = yes) [boolean]
        Whether to output a poissonian fit to the histograms.
    
    (rows = '-') [string]
        The rows of the input file to include in the histogram.
    
    (sensecase = yes) [boolean]
        Whether to be case sensitive about column names.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.  Calculate the events/pixel in the  input  file  input.fits,  and
    write the results into output.fits:
    
         ft> sishist input.fits output.fits
    
    2.  As above, but do not output fits to the output file:
    
         ft> sishist input.fits output.fits fit=no
    
    
    
NOTES:
    Please  send  comments  and recommendations on the fitting performed
    by this program to ascahelp@legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov
