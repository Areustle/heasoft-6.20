NAME
    correctrdd - Apply RDD correction to  ASCA  SIS  FAINT,  BRIGHT,  or
    BRIGHT2 data
    
    
USAGE
    correctrdd infile outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  is  written  specifically  to process data from the ASCA
    X-ray satellite and requires a SIS FAINT, BRIGHT or BRIGHT2  science
    mode  file  as  input,  although  the accuracy of correction for the
    latter 2 modes is  less  than  for  the  FAINT  mode.   It  requires
    Residual  Dark  Distribution  (RDD) map(s) for the appropriate chip,
    mode, and time period produced by the  SIS  team,  and  applies  the
    pixel-by-pixel correction of the CCD dark level.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [string]
        The name of the input file to be corrected for RDD.
    
    outfile [string]
        The name of the output file.
    
    S0C0rdd [string]
        The  name  of  the RDD map file for s=0, c=0. This file is asked
        for depending on the input file.
    
    S0C1rdd [string]
        The name of the RDD map file for s=0, c=1. This  file  is  asked
        for depending on the input file.
    
    S0C2rdd [string]
        The  name  of  the RDD map file for s=0, c=2. This file is asked
        for depending on the input file.
    
    S0C3rdd [string]
        The name of the RDD map file for s=0, c=3. This  file  is  asked
        for depending on the input file.
    
    S1C0rdd [string]
        The  name  of  the RDD map file for s=1, c=0. This file is asked
        for depending on the input file.
    
    S1C1rdd [string]
        The name of the RDD map file for s=1, c=1. This  file  is  asked
        for depending on the input file.
    
    S1C2rdd [string]
        The  name  of  the RDD map file for s=1, c=2. This file is asked
        for depending on the input file.
    
    S1C3rdd [string]
        The name of the RDD map file for s=1, c=3. This  file  is  asked
        for depending on the input file.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean])
        Flag  specifying whether or not a  pre-existing  file  with  the
        same  name  as that  requested as the output file from this task
        will be overwritten.
