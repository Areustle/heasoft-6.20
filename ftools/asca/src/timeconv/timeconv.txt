NAME
    timeconv - converts satellite time to barycentric time
    
    
USAGE
    timeconv infile timeop ra dec geofile frforbit
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Routine to transform TIME column in  a  fitsfile  from  ASCATIME  at
    satellite  to  ASCATIME at the geocenter, Barycentric Dynamical Time
    (TDB), or ASCATIME at the solar system barycenter.
    
    ROUTINE:
    
    asca_geocen.c : Subroutine for geocentric correction
        Use atFunctions and read frf.orbit(orbit database).
    
    asca_barycen.f : Subroutine for barycentric correction
        Use  Prof.  Deeter  's  routine(jpleph)  and   read   earth.dat( 
        geometry database of Earth ).
    
    TIME SYSTEM:
    
    TDT and TDB : Terrestrial and Barycentric Dynamical Time
        Dynamical  time  is  the  concept  of  time  that is used as the
        variable in gravitational equations of motion.  It is  based  on
        the  SI(Systeme  International)  second  and  measured by atomic
        clocks.  It commenced in 1977,  when  the  relationship  between
        TDT and TAI was defined to be:
        
             TDT = TAI + 32.184 sec.
        
        TDB  is intended for use in the equations of motion of planetary
        bodies referred to the barycentre or the solar  system.   It  is
        not  uniquely  defined  but depends on the theory of gravitation
        that is adopted. However, it is stipulated that it differs  from
        TDT by only periodic discrepancies.
    
    TAI : International Atomic Time
        TAI is defined by the atomic clocks.
    
    UTC : Coordinated Universal Time
        UTC  differs from TAI by an integral number of seconds.  In 1993
        Jan 1, UTC differs from TAI by 27  sec.   In  1993  Jul  1,  UTC
        differs from TAI by 28 sec.
    
    ASCATIME :
        ASCATIME is defined to be:
        
             ASCATIME = TAI  - 27.0 sec.

PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The  name of the input FITS file (and extension number in square
        brackets, or indicated with  a  +;  the  default  is  the  first
        extension).   The  times  in  this file will be overwritten with
        the barycentric times.
    
    timeop = 2 [integer]
        The type of time system to transform  TIME  column  to.   1  for
        ASCATIME  at  the  geocenter,  2 for TDB (seconds from 1993 Jan.
        1.0 TDB), or 3 for ASCATIME at the solar system barycenter.
        
    
    ra [double]
        The right Ascension of the target.
    
    dec [double]
        The declination of the target.
    
    geofile = "earth.dat" [filename]
        The path and file  name  of  the  file  containing  the  earth's
        geometry.
    
    frforbit = "frf.orbit" [filename]
        The   path  and  file  name  of  the ASCA orbital parameter file
        (orbit file).  ASCA  orbital  parameters  are  determined  every
        week,  and  the  new  entry  is  added to the orbital file. More
        recently updated orbit files than the  observation  date  should
        be  used.   For  US  guest observers, the latest orbital file is
        included in the data distrbution package.
        
        Example locations:
            frforbit = "/nagatsuki/f1/orbit/frf.orbit"
        Example for miranda.phys.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp
            frforbit = "/frf/orbit/frf.orbit"
    
    (timcolname = TIME) [string]
        The name of the time column to be changed.
    
    (extrapolate = no) [boolean]
        Whether to extrapolate orbital elements of  the  satellite  more
        than two weeks after.
    
    (verbose = yes) [boolean]
        Whether to output many informational messages to the terminal.
    
    (history = yes) [boolean]
        Whether to add history record to headers.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   Convert  the  times in the file input.dat to barycentric times.
    The target is located at 83.63  ra  and  22.01  dec  and  the  earth
    geometry  file  and  orbital  information  file  are  in the current
    directory.
