NAME
    corpileup -- read SIS event file affected by pile-up, and output 
		 pile-up-corrected spectrum

USAGE
    corpileup inevent outpha
 
DESCRIPTION
    This task reads an SIS event file affected by the event pile-up, estimates
    amounts of the pile-up, and outputs a spectrum in which pile-up effects are
    corrected as much as possible.  Works only for 1CCD mode observations.

    This program finds a point source position, discards a circular region 
    around the source where pile-up is too significant to be corrected, 
    estimates amount of the pile-up, and calculates the pile-up free 
    (supposedly) energy spectrum.

    This task divides the event file into many time segments, and calculates 
    pile-up for each segment separately, so that effect of the attitude 
    fluctuation is taken into account.

    Pileup is corrected in the following manner.
    First, Let's assume the following conventions: 
        img0:    raw image (affected by piled-up) 
	img1:    simulated incident image
	pha0:    raw spectrum (affected by the pile-up)
	pha1:    simulated incident spectrum
	pha2:    simulated spectrum affected by the piled-up 
	pha3:    estimated spectrum of only the events causing pile-up 

    0. The region where flux is higher than 0.023 cnt/pixel/exposure is
    determined to be discarded in the following process (the flux
    threshold has been determined empirically).

    1. img0 and pha0 are produced from the input raw event file.

    2. Chip is divided into many annuli so that each annulus has approximately
     a constant flux level.  Events for each annulus are considered separately
    in the following step (but combined to create spectra and images).

    3. For each annulus, time order (= read-out order) of all the events from 
    all the read-out is randomized.

    4. Let's consider a particular annulus in the i-th read-out in which N 
    events are originally detected.  N events are picked up from the 
    randomized event series (and recorded as img1 and pha1), and input on a 
    "virtual chip", and resultant charge distributions on the chip are 	
    simulated. The on-board event detection algorithm is applied on the 
    virtual chip.  

    Note that the number of the simulated events detected on the virtual chip 
    should be less or equal to N due to pile-up.  More events are picked-up 
    from the randomized event series (and added to img1 and pha1), until N 
    simulated events are detected. The simulated events detected on the 
    virtual chip are recorded as pha2.

    5. Repeat 4 for all the CCD read-out (each 4-sec).

    6. Calculate the pure pile-up spectrum as pha3 = pha2 - pha1.

    7. Correct pile-up as output-pha = pha0 - pha3. Statistical error
    of the output pha file is calculated assuming that events in pha0 and pha3 
    follow the Poisson distribution.


PARAMETERS  

    inevent [filename]
	The input event file. Proper screening (including hot-pixel removal) 
	should be already applied. 

    outpha [filename]
        The output pileup-corrected spectrum file name.

   (timebin = 720) [real]
        The event file is divided into time segments of which duration 
	is specified by this parameter. The satellite attitude should be stable
	within this time interval. This parameter is useful when the attitude 
	is not stable.

    coorsys (coorsys =  det ) [string]
        Specify the coordinate  used for the source position. 
	It can take raw, det or sky.  

    tentcenx (tentcentx = 456 ) [real] 
        The X coordinate of tentative source position. This task searches
	for the source position within a 50 pixel radius circle  within
	the tentative position.

    tentceny (tentcenty = 456) [real] 
        The Y coordinate of tentative source position. This task searches
	for the source position within a 50 pixel radius circle within the
	tentative position.

    (disr=-99) [real]
        Radius of the circle within which events are discarded for the
	processing. If this parameter is negative, the radius whithin which 
	the  flux exceeds the 0.023 cnt/pixel/exposure threshold is calculated
	and used.

    (pha0 = corpileup_raw.spec) [filename]
        File name of the observed raw spectrum.

    (pha1 = corpileup_sim_inc.spec) [filename]
        File name of the simulated incident spectrum. 

    (pha2 = corpileup_sim_out.spec) [filename]
	File name of the simulated piled-up spectrum. 

    (pha3 = corpileup_sim_pile-up.spec) [filename]
	File name of the pure pile-up spectrum.

    (img0 = corpileup_raw.img) [filename]
   	Observed RAW image of the chip.  
	Note that the original RAWX and RAWY values are defined 
	in the ranges of 0-425 and 0-422 respectively, and the corpileup 
	creates images in this range (i.e., lower left pixel corresponds to 
	RAWX=0 and RAWY=0).

	On the other hand, "Active Pixels" on the chip which can detect X-ray
	photons start from RAWX=6 and RAWY=1, and these are specified in the 
	event file header as the TLMIN* keywords.  Consequently, the lower left
	pixel of the RAW image created with xselect/extractor corresponds to 
	RAWX=6 and RAWY=1.  This difference has to be taken into account to 
	precisely compare the RAW images created by corpileup and xselect. 

   (img1 = corpileup_sim_inc.img) [filename]
        File name of the simulated incident image in the RAW coordinates. 
	PSF center within the radius specified by the "disc" parameter
	is discarded. 

   (psf = corpileup_psf.qdp) [filename]
	Name of the QDP format file of the PSF created from the input event 
	file.  Unit of the x-axis is the radius in pixel and that of y-axis
	is counts/pixel/exposure. 

   (clobber = no) [boolean]
        If yes, the output files will be overwrittern. 

FAQ
    Q. How can I start?
    A. Make or obtain a calibrated and screened (hot-pixel-removed) SIS event 
    file, only from the region you are interested (usually within some radius
    from a bright point source), then use this task. You may want to use the 
    entire chip instead, in that case region selection is not needed.

    Q. What kind of ARF should I use?
    A. From the input event file you are going to use, create a dummy SIS 
    spectrum only for the purpose of making ARF with ascaarf.  Region selection
    have to be made so that the same detector region corpileup uses is 
    selected. The source position and the radius of the discarded circle by
    corpileup is recorded in the HISTORY header of the output spectral file.

    Q. The output psf by corpileup is strange, e.g., the peak is dull and 
    broad. It does not reach the 0.023 cnt/pixel/exposure threshold.
    A. You should suspect the source position determination.  Check the source
    center position corpileup outputs on the screen, and compare it with the
    image created with other tools such as xselect. If they are significantly 
    different, specify the correct center position with tentcenx and tentceny 
    parameters (either in 'det' or 'sky' coordinates).

    Make sure that you are using the CORRECT COORDINATE ('det','sky' or 'raw') 
    specified with the coorsys parameter, and that the source position is 
    given WITHOUT binning. To remove the default binning in xselect,
    enter 'set xybinsize 1'.

    Q. "Warning. loopcounter=20 at ring **" is printed out frequently.  And/or
    the output image has a "black hole" NOT centered on the point source, or 
    does not have such a black hole at all.  
    A. Suspect the source position determination. Specify the tentative source
     position (tentcenx and tentceny options).

    Q. My target is masked on board. Can I use this task?
    A. Not now. Contact kotani@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov

    Q. The observation mode is FAINT. Can I use this task?
    A. Yes.  Use the event files after converted to the BRIGHT or BRIGHT2 mode.

    Q. Telemetry is saturated. Can I use this task?
    A. Yes. Be sure that the source position is determined correctly.
