GQAPLOT (Aug93)                ftools.asca               GQAPLOT (Aug93)



NAME
    gqaplot -- GIS quick analysis ftool.
    
    Read a GIS science fits file, and  plot  GIS  image,  pha  spectrum,
    light curve, and pha-rise time diagram in a screen.
    
    Also,  primary  information  on the science file is output to a text
    file (or screen).
    
    
USAGE
    gqaplot infile outfile device
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [string]
        ASCA GIS science file  name  or  the  file  name  in  which  GIS
        science  file  names are written each for one line.  If the file
        name starts with '@', e.g. @file_list,  the  file  file_list  is
        opened and GIS science file names are read from this file.
        
    
    outfile [string]
        Output file name (STDOUT for the terminal output).
        
    
    (xname [RAWX, DETX, X])
        Column name for the image X-axis.
        
    
    (yname [RAWY, DETY, Y])
        Column name for the image Y-axis.
        
    
    (phname [PHA, PI])
        Column name for the pulse height spectrum.
        
    
    (phalog [yes, no])
        Draw  the  pulse  height  spectrum with log (yes) or linear (no)
        scale.
        
    
    (englog [yes, no])
        Energy space for the spectrum log (yes) or  linear  (no)  scale.
        If yes, the unit of the abscissa becomes energy, not channel.
        
    
    (rtname [RISE_TIME, RTI])
        Column name of the Rise Time.
        
    
    (contour [yes, no])
        Draw the contour map of the image (yes) or not (no).
        
    
    (imagelog [yes, no])
        The scale of the contour log (yes) or linear (no).
        
    
    (gray [yes, no])
        Draw the gray map of the image(yes) or not(no).
        
    
    (dotmap [yes, no])
        Draw the dotmap of the image(yes) or not(no).
        
    
    device [string]
        PGPLOT  device name (e.g., /xw for xwindow, /ps for post script,
        ? for inquiry).
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Plot GIS image, pha spectrum, light  curve,  pha-rise  time  diagram
    quickly.
    
    Remember,  image  and pha-rise time diagram are not available in the
    MPC mode.  Important information on the science file  is  output  to
    the output file.
    
    Contact Ken Ebisawa (NASA/GSFC) for detail.

BUGS
    
    When  using  dotmap for image with /xw or /ps being the plot device,
    artificial grid structure may appear. It might be due to  a  bug  in
    the pgplot.
