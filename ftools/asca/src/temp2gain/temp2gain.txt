TEMP2GAIN (Mar97)                                          TEMP2GAIN (Mar97)

NAME
    temp2gain -- Make a GIS gain history file in FITS format from FRF file.

VERSION
    4.2

USAGE
    temp2gain frffile calfile outfile tblfile g2hfile g3hfile method steptime

DESCRIPTION
    This task reads a FRF file and makes a GIS gain history file in FITS
    format which is used for ASCALIN. The GIS gain is calculated with a
    function of ASCATIME and TEMPERATURE. The parameters of the function
    are written in the calibration file supported by the GIS team.
    Don't forget to check the gain history file by fplot(X axis:CAL_START,
    Y axis:TEMP_S2 FE55_PEAK_S2 TEMP_S3 FE55_PEAK_S3)

PARAMETERS

    frffile [file name]
	The FRFfile name, you are going to process.

    calfile [file name]
	The name of the calibration file including time history of
	calibration parameters (gis_temp2gain.fits).
	This file is updated every 30 days by the GIS team.

    outfile [file name]
	The name of the output gain history file in FITS format
	which is used for ASCALIN.

    tblfile [file name]
	The table file name in ascii format.
	The contents are almost the same as outfile.

    g2hfile [file name]
	The GIS2 LDHIT table file name in ascii format.

    g3hfile [file name]
	The GIS3 LDHIT table file name in ascii format.

    method [integer] (0:Auto, 1:Linear Interpolation, 2:Analytic function)
	Method of calculating the GIS gain.
	1: By interpolating the monthly coefficients written on
	   the gis_temp2gain.fits.
	2: Analytic function calculated from Apr.'93-Jan.'94 data.
	   The parameters are written on gis_temp2gain.fits.
	0: Automatically selects "Analytic function" for Apr.1993 - Jan.1994
	   and "Linear Interpolation" otherwise. 
	   you are recommended to select "Auto".

    steptime [double precision] (sec)
	Time interval while the temperature is averaged.
	If you set this parameter "0", the temperature is not averaged. 
	Set 1800 if you want to set it as long as used in MKGAINHIST. 

    (hidden parameters)

    (version = 4) [integer]
	The version number for file format of output FITS file.
	You have to set it 4.

    (ldh_flag = no) [boolean]
	Flag for applying gain correction with LDHIT counting rate.
	The LDHIT correction function is still under investigation and
	is not guaranteed. At default, it is set to no.

    (nor_fac2 = 1) [double precision]
	Normalization Factor for GIS2, with which you can perform a gain
	correction factor in your custom-made way.
	When you use ftools-3.5-ASCALIN and want to perform
	time-dependent Gain Map correction, you can use this gain factor.
	The nor_fac2 is constant over the whole field of view. 

    (nor_fac3 = 1) [double precision]
	Normalization Factor for GIS3
	See above.

    (mergesec = 2) [double precision]
	Margin Seconds. 
 	Start time of the gain history file is (FRFstart time - mergesec),
	and the end time is (FRFend time + mergesec).

    (clobber = no) [boolean]
	If  true, output file will be overwrite a file  of the same name,
	if it exists.
