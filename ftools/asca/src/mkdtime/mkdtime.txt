NAME
    mkdtime  -- Create a file of GIS deadtimes or fill in columns of MKF
    file
    
    
USAGE
    mkdtime infile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    MKDTIME creates a file of GIS deadtimes based  on  the  input  file.
    if  the  outfile  name  is set to "NONE", the default, the specified
    deadtime  columns  in  the  input  MKFILTER2  file  are  filled  in. 
    Separate  values  are  calculated for each instrument.  The deadtime
    is set to zero for unphysical (i.e. <0) count rates.  If  the  value
    of  L1  (events  which  pass  the rise time and PH discriminator) is
    below the value of the maximum allowable error  in  l1:  minl1,  the
    deadtime is calculated using:
    
                                  Gn_TELM
    GIS dead time fraction = 1 -  --------
                                  Gn_CPU_O
    
    The  values are integrated until the CPU input (Gn_CPU_I) counts are
    statistically  significant  based  on  the  cpucts  parameter.   The 
    deadtime is calculated by the formula:
    
                                                          Gn_CPU_I   Gn_TELM
    GIS dead time fraction = 1 - ( 1 - Gn_LDHIT * tau ) * -------- * --------
                                                           Gn_L1     Gn_CPU_O
    
    The  output  file  can  be in either expanded HK format (the assumed
    file type by downstream software) or compressed HK format.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        The name and extension for input MKFILTER2  file.  Any  file  in
        expanded  HK  format  with  all  of  the required columns can be
        used.  The  required  columns  are:  TIME,  GIS_MODE,  Gn_LDHIT,
        Gn_L1,  Gn_CPU_I, Gn_CPU_O and Gn_TELM, where Gn are both G2 and
        G3.
    
    outfile = "NONE" [filename]
        The  name  and  extension   containing   the   output   deadtime 
        information.   If  NONE  is  specified,  the  requested deadtime
        columns in the input file are filled in. At  present,  the  task
        supports outfile = "NONE" specification only.
    
    (minl1 = 20) [integer]
        The minimum value of Gn_L1 for which to calculate a deadtime.
    
    (cpucts = 0.05) [real]
        The maximum allowable relative error in the Gn_CPU_I counts.
    
    (tau = 0.000025) [real]
        The response time of the ADC.
    
    (timecol = "TIME") [string]
        The name of the time column in the input and output files.
    
    (deadcol = "DEADT") [string]
        The  postfix  of  the fractional deadtime in the output deadtime
        file.  The column names  will  be  prefixed  with  G2_  and  G3_
        respectively.
    
    (ldcol = "LDHIT") [string]
        The postfix of the LD hit rate columns.
    
    (l1col = "L1") [string]
        The postfix of the L1 columns.
    
    (cpuicol = "CPU_I") [string]
        The postfix of the CPU input count rate columns.
    
    (cpuocol = "CPU_O") [string]
        The postfix of the CPU output count rate columns.
    
    (telmcol = "TELM") [string]
        The postfix of the telemetry rate columns.
    
    (compact = no) [boolean]
        Whether  to  make  the  output file in "compact" HK format (i.e.
        TIME, NAME, VALUE columns) or  in  "expanded"  HK  format  (i.e.
        with  TIME,  G2_DEADTIME, G3_DEADTIME columns).  Most downstream
        software assumes the latter.  If "NONE"  is  specified  for  the
        output file, this parameter is ignored.
    
    (sensecase = no) [boolean]
        Whether to be case sensitive about column names.
