SISCLEAN (Aug93)               ftools.asca              SISCLEAN (Aug93)



NAME
    sisclean  -  This  task  creates  an SAOimage region file which will
    remove the 'hot' and 'flickering' pixels from an sis image.
    
    
USAGE
    sisclean imfil clnim sisreg plotdv
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The task takes an SIS image.  First it plots the  number  of  counts
    per  pixel  against  the number of pixels with that many counts.  It
    also plots a gaussian distribution of pixels for  comparison.   Then
    the  user  is  prompted  for  a pixel cutoff, and an SAOimage region
    file is written which excludes all the pixels with  more  than  that
    many  counts.  The task also writes a cleaned image, with the pixels
    removed.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    imfil [filename]
        The name of the image file (in the primary extension).
    
    clnim [filename]
        The name of the output cleaned image.
    
    sisreg [filename]
        The output SAOimage format region file.
    
    plotdv [string]
        The plotting device (in PGPLOT) for the pixel  count  vs.  pixel
        hits plot.
    
    (plot = yes) [boolean]
        Should the plot be drawn?
    
    pixcut [integer]
        The pixel cutoff value.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   Produce a cleaned region (sisreg.cln) and image (clean_image.xsl)
         file for the input image xsel_image.xsl.  Do put up the plot, using
         the Xwindows driver of PGPLOT.
