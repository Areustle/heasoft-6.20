NAME
    ldeadtime -- Carry out deadtime correction for FITS light curves.
    
    
USAGE
    ldeadtime lcfile mkffile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    LDEADTIME  calculates live time fraction for each light-curve bin in
    a FITS light curve (lcfile)  based on deadtime values given  in  the
    MKFILTER  file  (mkffile).  This task was primarily written for ASCA
    GIS, but may be used for similar instruments.  LDEADTIME  fills  the
    'FRACEXP'  fractional  exposure column, whose value is the live-time
    fraction for each time-bin.  These values are  originally  one  when
    the  lcfile  is  created with xselect/extractor without the deadtime
    correction.  After the deadtime correction with  LDEADTIME,  FRACEXP
    takes  values  between  zero and one.  New RATE and ERROR values are
    calculated  by  dividing  original  values  by  FRACEXP,  and  these 
    columns are overwritten.
    
    Since  the  lcfile   is  updated  it would be prudent to make a copy
    of the input lcfile before running this task, in  the   event   that
    it   does  not complete  successfully  and  leaves  the  file  in  a
    corrupted state.
    
    The  details  of  the  ASCA  GIS  'deadtime'  fraction   calculation 
    procedure is given in the MKDTIME task description.
    
    If  any  FRACEXP  values  are zero (this should not happen), warning
    messages are displayed on the screen, and RATE and ERROR values  are
    set to -999.0.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    lcfile [filename]
        The  name  and  extension  for  input  light  curve  file.   The 
        'FRACEXP' column  of  the  lcfile  is  filled,  and  'RATE'  and
        'ERROR' columns are overwritten.
    
    mkffile [filename]
        The name and extension for input MKFILTER file.
    
    (mkfbnwidth = "BN_WIDTH") [string]
        The name of the column in the mkffile which tells the bin width.
    
    (g2deadt = "G2_DEADT") [string]
        The name of the G2_DEADT column in the mkffile.
    
    (g3deadt = "G3_DEADT") [string]
        The name of the G3_DEADT column in the mkffile.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    
    1.   Carry  out  the  deadtime correction  for  the light curve file
    'g2.curve'  based  on  deadtime  values   in   the   mkfilter   file 
    'ft941123_0821_2301.mkf'.
