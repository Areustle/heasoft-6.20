** Version Overview History **

SISRMG version 0.4 is the first version of the SIS response matrices in
which the MIT and ISAS response generation approaches have been merged.  It
produces response matrices which are equivalent to those produced by the
SIS_BLDRSP generator.  [This version is no longer supported.]

SISRMG version 0.5 includes a preliminary model for the low-PH tail in
the response, but is otherwise identical to version 0.4 for all chips.
[This version is no longer supported.]

SISRMG version 0.6 includes improvements to the low-PH tail model
for partial charge collected events near the gate structure.
[This version is no longer supported.]

SISRMG version 0.7 includes in addition a high-PH tail model for partial
charge collected events deep in the depletion layer.  [This version is no
longer supported.]

SISRMG version 0.8 includes ISAS QE determinations for individual chips,
PI matrix capability, and preliminary gain corrections for CTI.  [This
version is retained for comparison purposes.]

SISRMG version 0.9 includes a preliminary model for the effects of the
Residual Dark Distribution on shape of the response features.  It also
updates echo-uncorrected matrices for the measured echo at the time of
the current observation.  Rudimentary support for light leaks is included.
It also includes minor bug fixes and enhancements.  [This version is retained
for comparison purposes.]

SISRMG version 1.0 includes a treatment for nonuniform CTI effects,
support for the new version of FAINTDFE, and access to the RDD secular
history.  The user interface has been completely reworked to allow most
parameters to be obtained from the PHA file.  [This version is subsumed
in the following.]

SISRMG version 1.1 includes a number of minor bug fixes; it produces
essentially the same matrix as the previous version.  The event threshold
is now correctly accounted for with PI matrices.  If the event file has
been RDD corrected, RDD corrections are disabled.
