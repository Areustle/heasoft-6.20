NAME
    fastwmap -- Add a WMAP to a FAST mode spectral file
    
    
USAGE
    fastwmap infile outfile binsize
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The extractor task does not  put  a  Weighted  map  in  the  primary
    extension  of  the spectral files it produces for ASCA SIS FAST mode
    data.  This task will create a new FITS  file,  copy  over  all  the
    other  extensions,  and  put a WMAP into the primary extension. This
    task reads from the spectrum  header  the  information  required  to
    deduce the region from which the spectrum was extracted.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The FITS file to copy and add a WMAP to.
    
    outfile [file name]
        The new FITS file containing the WMAP.
    
    binsize [integer]
        The bin size for the WMAP to be written.
    
    calfile [file name]
        The  path  to the s?_teldef_ascalin.fits file. If this is set to
        CALDB then fastwmap will look for the file  in  the  calibration
        database.  If  calfile is set to AUTO then fastwmap first checks
        the calibration database and if this fails it checks the  ftools
        refdata area.
    
    clobber [boolean]
        Overwrite the output file if it exists.
        
        
EXAMPLES
    1.  Add  a  WMAP  to  data  in  infile.pha,  writing  the  result to
       outfile.pha. Set the WMAP binning to 8.
    
    ft> fastwmap infile.pha outfile.pha 8
