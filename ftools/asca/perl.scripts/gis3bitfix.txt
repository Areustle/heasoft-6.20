   All GIS3 PH data acquired in PHA mode between Feb 10 and Apr 8 1994 suffer
   from an on-board software related problem. The 3 LSB PHA bits are stuck
   in the pattern 101; some time resolution may be lost. This script makes
   a set of reprocessed, fixed GIS3 PHA science files. However the digital
   resolution of the resultant spectra is necessarily decreased to 7 bits.

   The arguments are: 1) a file containing a list of (previously processed)
   affected GIS3 event files, 2) those necessary to run ASCALIN.
   The resultant files have the extension .fix appended to the file name.

 Usage: gis3bitfix evtlist calfile timfile attfile    (Process evtlist files)

 where
   evtlist = name of file containing a list of event files to be corrected
   calfile = name of teldef file       (the gis3_phnew* file)
   timfile = name of gain history file (the ft*.ghf     file)
   attfile = name of attitude file     (the fa*         file)
 Too few command line arguments, please try again.
