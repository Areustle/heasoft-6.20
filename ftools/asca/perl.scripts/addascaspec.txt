addascaspec version 1.27  1998-08-23

usage: addascaspec [-qh] list_file out_spec out_response [outbgd] 

addascaspec is a perl script used to combine ASCA spectra taken by
SIS0 and SIS1 or GIS2 and GIS3.  It can also be used to add spectra
taken at different times.
The following ftools are invoked; fparkey, fkeypar, mathpha, addarf, 
addrmf, marfrmf, and pget.

Flags:
-h   Print this help message.
-q   Display commands to spawn, but does not execute them.

The 'list_file' should have the following format: 

g2_source.spec g3_source.spec 
g2_bgd.spec g3_bgd.spec  
g2.arf g3.arf 

On each line, list the spectra, background, arf, and rmf file
names to combine. You can add two or more spectral files. 
Order of the appearance of lines does not matter, but source
spectral files should appear prior to the background files.
You may or may not enter background files and rmf files to combine.

Note that in the case of GIS, you do not have to add RMFs,
since GIS2 and 3 RMFs are identical. In this case only ARFs
are averaged.  For SIS, each ARF and RMF are multiplied and
averaged.

The method of calculation is explained in the ASCA ABC guide 
(http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/abc/) section 8.9.
The background normalization is calculated with the formula explained at 
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/abc_backscal.html.
