make_ascaray_image version 1.1

USAGE:
     make_ascaray_image

EXPLANATION:
make_ascaray_images is a perl script to run the ftool "ascaray"
sequentially for 300 energies from 0.1 keV to 12 keV.
The output ray-trace images are used as input of "ascaray" to
create ARFs with "raytrace=yes" option.  This method of crating
ARF will be particularly effective for diffuse sources, though
point-source ARFs may be used in the same manner.

Users are prompted for the following inputs; name of the output file list
(used for ascaarf input), number of input photons, either the source is 
extended or point-like, source extension (for extended case) or source
position (point-source case), mirror surface gold density, origin of the
atomic constants, image size (either GIS or SIS), energy range of the output,
and either compress the output file or not.
