                Fv Installation Instructions (UNIX)

After downloading and unpacking the fv distribution tar file,
make sure that the directory path to the fv executable file is
included in your PATH environment variable.  If you use a C Shell
(csh, tcsh) then this is usually defined in the .cshrc file in
your home directory.  If you use Bourne Shell (sh, ash, ksh, and
bash) then it is usually defined in the .login file in your home
directory.

Edit your .cshrc or .login file so that your PATH includes the full
directory path to the "fv" executable file.  You will then need to
'source' your .cshrc or .login for the changes to take effect in
your environment.  After this, you can start up fv by entering
"fv <CR>" or "fv filename.fits <CR>" in the UNIX command window.

If you wish to use ds9 as the image display device in fv, then
you also need to include the path to the ds9 executable in your
PATH setting.

ds9 is available from the SAO at http://hea-www.harvard.edu/RD/ds9/
