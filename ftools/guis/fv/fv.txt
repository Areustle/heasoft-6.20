NAME
    fv -- Interactive FITS file viewer and editor
    
    
USAGE
    fv [-cmap n] [filename] [filename] [...]
    
    
DESCRIPTION

    This task  is an interactive  browser, editor,  and viewer GUI for
    FITS files.  With it  you can view  and modify FITS file  headers,
    tables,  and images in spreadsheet  form.   You can display images
    and plot columns  from tables and  dump the output to a Postscript
    file for printing.   You can invoke  fv  by simply typing  'fv' at
    your command prompt.  More information is available as online help
    by clicking with  your mouse on  the "Help" button visible in each
    window of the GUI.

    
    
PARAMETERS

    filename    

       If one or more filenames are  specified on the command line for
       fv, it will start by opening that file rather than presenting a
       file chooser window.  Since the default mode of fv is to open a
       file  read/write, if you don't  have write privilege on a file,
       you will need to start fv without arguments and check the 'Open
       file read only' box before proceeding.

    -cmap n

       On unix machines, fv can run in either pseudocolor or truecolor
       mode.  By default it will choose the best available mode (n=0).
       You can force fv into truecolor mode by with n=2.  With n=1, fv
       will try to install a private, pseudocolor colormap.

BUGS

    POW, the  image display tool used by  fv,  will try to  allocate a
    portion of the current screen's colormap in pseudocolor mode.  You
    may  need  to   exit   netscape  (and similar   high  color  usage
    applications) before displaying  images in  fv  or you  may not be
    able to read the buttons in the display window.
