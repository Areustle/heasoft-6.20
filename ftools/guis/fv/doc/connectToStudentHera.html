<h3>Connect to Student Hera</h3>

<P>
Hera is an interface to software and data provided by the High Energy Astrophysics 
Science Archive Research Center at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center. The data are 
from satellites which detect x-rays and gamma rays from objects such as black holes, 
neutron stars, galaxies, and supernovae.
</p>

<P>
This interface has been adapted for use by students, educators, amateur astronomers 
and the general public, and allows them to use the same software that astronomers 
use on the same data sets that astronomers analyze. These data may be used for 
extensions of classroom lessons, science fair projects, research projects, etc.
</p>

<P>
Student Hera guides students through a self-assessed series of activities, starting 
with practice interpreting light curves for binary systems. Students then install 
Hera access data from the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer satellite (RXTE). Students 
analyze the data and compare their results with results in the professional literature. 
A file of the assessment results can be electronically saved and submitted to the professor.
</p>

<P>
There are different ways to start up a Student Hera session. But first, tare two basic 
requirements to run Student Hera:
</p>

<UL>
   <LI>A direct broadband Internet connection, and</LI>
   <LI>Any firewall, if present, must be configured to allow communication with Hera servers.</LI>
</UL>
