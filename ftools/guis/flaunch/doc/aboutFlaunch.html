	<b><h3> flaunch is a new tool and as such is still under
	  development.</h3></b> 
	<b> Unfortunately, the <em>hyper-help</em> utility built into
	  the itcl interface does not handle some HTML constructs
	  properly, so this help is best viewed with Netscape at this time.</b>

	An FTOOL GUI environment which allows the user to edit FTOOL parameter
	files, and run ALL FTOOLS, whether interactive or
	non-interactive from within a graphical interface, developed
	at the <EM>High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research
	  Center (HEASARC)</EM> at <B>NASA/ GSFC</B>.
      <P>
	This tool is presently being proto-typed and is under
	design. Some of the windows may change as will the options
	present as time goes on. Generally buttons will probably have
	been absorbed into menu's so if a button is not present the
	user should look under the various menu's present. Also, the
	<em>look</em> will generally remain the same. This is an
	beta verion of this tool and more options will be added over
	time. 
      <P>
	A new user should call "flaunch" and chose the 
	<a href="Fl_menubuttons.html">"Options"</a>
	menubutton and "select" the appropriate configuration
	parameters and "save" that information. This will create a
	".flaunchrc" file in the users $HOME directory which contains
	this information. 
      <p>
	This tool has two separate and distinct functions (as
	distributed):
      <ol><li> If called from the command line with a task specified,
	  i.e., <a href="Par_edit_window.html#Command_call"><b>flaunch
	      fdump</b></a> 
	  the tool is spawned in such a way that it displays
	  a parameter editing window, and when "Run" all output is
	  directed to the original calling window, i.e., the GUI
	  terminates completely. [This is a configurable option and
	  can be set from the 
	   <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#Options">"Options" menu</a>
	  in the "flaunch" window.] <p>
	<li> If called alone, i.e., 
	  <a href="Flaunch.html"><b>flaunch</b></a> then the tool operates
	  as a complete FTOOL environment allowing the user to run
	  multiple FTOOLs and examine the output from each 
	  <a href="Executed_tasks.html">executed task</a> in real-time in either
	  their own <a href="Terminal.html">"terminal window"</a> or via an 
	  <a href="Executed_tasks.html#output_log">output log file</a> that is
	  created. This allows the user to run tools in the background
	  while running others in the foreground and interactively
	  inputting information if necessary, e.g., fplot. This option
	  is the most powerful of the two, and will eventually allow the
	  user to create interactive scripts and then submit them, or
	  save them to be run at another time via this tool. 
</ol>
<p>
	Certain FTOOLs have problems displaying their output in
	real-time to the little terminal emulator due to the speed of
	the output, or require interactive I/O and there is no way to
	determine these Ftools by simply examining their parameter
	file. However, the user can control if a task is to be run
	completely in the background in a 
	<a href="Flaunch.html#Output">non-interactive</a> manner, or
	in an <a href="Interactive.html">interactive</a> manner. (In
	either case all output is properly echoed to the 
	<a href="Executed_tasks.html#output_log">log file</a>
	which Flaunch allows the user
	to examine.) The tools that are known to cause problems at
	this point are:<p>

	Fdump: does NOT pause (as one would expect) when the
	output file specified is STDOUT and the <b>page</b> set to
	yes. This is due to the fact that Flaunch calls all tools
	specifying all parameters on the command-line. Fdump requires
	that <b>more</b> NOT be specified on the command-line for
	paging to be active. the user can control which parameters are
	included in the command-line string. <p>

	Fplot: requires that the user call the tool in an interactive
	mode, to issue commands to pgplot, or to "quit" the session,
	alternatively the "iconified" window can be open. <p>
	
	It should be noted that in general the FTOOLS which are most
	problematic are not particular suited for interactive
	usage. The functions of these tools have been superceded by
	the "Fits Viewer - fv". This tool allows the user to
	interactivelyl chose files, view them, plot the data, and edit
	the data as well as the headers in an interactive
	manner. The user can either call "fv" via the 
	 <a href="Task_selection.html">"Select a Task" window</a> where
	"fv" is entered as the task to execute, or by using either
	the <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#File">"Browse Files"</a>
	option in the 
	 <a href="Flaunch.html">"flaunch" window</a> and using the "fv"
	button after selecting a file, 
	or the
	  <a href="Par_menubuttons.html">"File selection" option</a> of
	the "File" menubutton in the
	   <a href="Par_edit_window.html">"Parameter Editing window"</a> 
<p>
<p>
	<b>Getting started:</b>
<br>
	There are two basic ways to start flaunch. 
      <ol><li> The first causes "flaunch" to run as a complete
	  interactive ftools
	  environment, allowing the user to edit, run, and examine the
	  screen output, and all created data files, from executed
	  ftools: <br> 
	  Call <a href="Flaunch.html"><b>flaunch</b></a>.
	<li> The second (which is configurable in the 
	   <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#Options">"Options" menu</a>)
	  causes flaunch to act as a simple parameter file
	  editor. Once the user us satisfied they can submit the tool,
	  this causes the flaunch session to terminate, and the tool
	  to be executed in the original calling window:<br>
	  Call <a href="Par_edit_window.html#command_line_call"><b>flaunch saextrct</b></a>.
</ol>

    <b>Mouse Buttons:</b>
      <ul>
	<li>Right-most-mouse button is equivalent to Button-3
	<li>Middle-mouse button is equivalent to Button-2
	<li>Left-most-mouse button is equivalent to Button-1
	<li>All actions bound to Button-3 can also be activated by using
	  Control-Button-3 (i.e., hold down the "Control" key while
	  simultaneously pressing Button-3) or Shift-Button-3 (this
	  will alleviate 
	  problems with various windowing-managers).
	<li>If you have a problem with any Button-N conflicts, try
	  using Control-Button-N or Shift-Button-N, many times this
	  will "fix" the problem. This is a standard feature
	  throughout Flaunch.
      </ul>
