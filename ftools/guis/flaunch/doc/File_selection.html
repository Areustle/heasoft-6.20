      <center><h1>File Selection Window</h1></center>
      <center><IMG SRC="file_selection.gif"></center><p>

	The "File Selection" window allows the user to perform several
	useful functions depending upon:
      <ul><li> How the File selection window was called. 
	  <ol><li>If the
	      window is called from <a href="Par_menubuttons.html">File</a>
	      menubutton within the <a href="Par_edit_window.html">Parameter
		Editing window</a>, (and no Entry-box had been
		previously selected) then the file selected is not
	      directly associated
	      with an "entry box" within the Parameter Editing
	      window. However, the default is to associate it with the
	      first entry box. There are two ways too change this
		behavior. 
		<ol type=A>
		  <li> You must have selected an Entry-box (place the
		    cursor on and Entry-box and press Button-1), and
		    then use either Control-f, or use the pull-down
		    menu. Then any items selected will be inserted in
		    the entry-box that was selected.
		  <li> You must select an entry
		    box and hit the third (right-most) mouse button -
		    Button-3. (If Button-3 is already used in your
		    window-manager, you can also use Control-Button-3 or 
		    Shift-Button-3.)
		</ol>

	      Of course any file high-lighted in the File selection window
	      can be copied into any entry box by using the left-mouse-button
	      (Button-1) to select a file, and then selecting an entry
		box within 
	      the Parameter Editing window, and using the
	      middle-mouse-button (Button-2) to insert the filename.<p>
	    <li> If this window was called by selecting an entry box from
	      within the Parameter Editing window and clicking the
	      right-most-mouse-button (Button-3) within an entry-box,
	      any file selected with the File selection window (or
	      associate windows, e.g., the 
		<a href="List_of_selected_items.html">List of selected items
		window</a>) will appear in that box 
	      once the <b>"OK"</b> button is clicked (or other
	      terminating action is taken). This also causes
	      the File  Selection window (and associated windows) to
	      disappear.  
	  </ol><p>

	  <li> Actions taken by pressing a button after a file is selected:
	  <ol><li> If the <b>"File"</b> menubutton is selected, the
	      user will be presented with a menu which contains a
	      series of options. <br> 
	      <center><IMG SRC="file_selection_file.gif"></center>
	      <ul TYPE=square><li><b>Make a list of files?</b>
		  (also 
		  accessible by pressing Control-m in the File
		  selection window):<br> 
		  causes a 
		   <a href="List_of_selected_items.html">"List of
		    selected items"</a>
		  window to appear. And operates in connection
		  with the right-most-mouse-button (Button-3). Files selected
		  in the "File selection window" by depressing the
		  right-most-mouse-button (Button-3) will appear in 
		  the "List of selected items" window.
		<li><b>Cancel?</b> (also accessible by
		  pressing Control-c):<br>
		  closes the "File
		  selection window" without returning anything to the
		  "Parameter Editing Window". 
	      </ul><p>
	    <li> If the <b>"Fv"</b> button is used then the
	      <a href="../../fv/doc/aboutFv.html">"fits_viewer"</a>
	      program is called. This program allows the user to view
	      FITS files as well as examine their contents and plot
	      the information. Thus once you select a file you can hit
	      the "Fv" button to examine the contents of that file,
	      before inputting it into the parameter entry box. This
	      button is provided as a convenience and launchs Fv which
	      is a separate program.<p>
	    <li> The <b>"OK"</b> button actually has two usages
	      depending upon how the "File Selection" window was
	      called. Basically, if the "File Selection" window was
	      called from the <a href="Par_menubuttons.html">File</a> 
	      menu, than the "OK" button is not bound to any entry-box
	      (although the tool now assumes you wish the output sent
	      to the first entry-box), however in general
	      the user should only use this when using the mouse to
	      copy the file into memory, and paste the selected file
	      to a particular entry-box using the middle-mouse-button
	      (Button-2). If the "File Selection" window was 
	      called by using the right-mouse-button (Button-3) from within an
	      entry-box than the selected file is inserted into that
	      entry-box. <p>
		If the user has selected the "<em>Attempt to uncompress
		  files automatically?</em>" option from the
		 <a href="Flaunch.html">"Flaunch"</a> window's 
		 <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#Options">"Option"
		  menubutton</a> 
		<p>
	    <li> If the <b>"Help"</b> menubutton is selected, the
	      user will be presented with a menu which
	      contains a series of options.<br>
	      <center><IMG SRC="file_selection_help.gif"></center>
	      <ul TYPE=square><li><b>About File selection</b>
		  (also 
		  accessible by pressing Control-h): <br>
		  displays the hypertext
		  help available on the "File selection window", i.e.,
		  the page you are presently looking at.
		<li><b>All Topics available</b> (also
		  accessible by pressing Control-a):<br> 
		  Displays the hypertext
		  help available on all Topics, i.e., a general INDEX
		  of available help pages for Flaunch are displayed,
		  allowing the user to select which windows or
		  behavior they wish to learn about. 
	      </ul> 
	  </ol>
      </ul>
	  Note: The Directory Selection window and the File Selection
	  window rely upon the same procedures, as such they cannot
	  co-exist at the same time without the potential for
	  posible conflicts arising. Thus the window is destroyed and
	  recreated each time it is called. This should not be a
	  problem is the user is calling this window as intended.
	  This window should be called, and used immediately after its
	  creation before the user moves on to other things. <p>
