      <center><h1>Flaunch window</h1></center>
      <center><IMG SRC="flaunch.gif"></center>
<p>
	This is the first screen that will appear. You will notice
	three menubuttons and a PACKAGES button. ALL menubuttons are
	displayed in Blue - standard buttons are displayed in other
	colors (e.g., the PACKAGES button). You can activate the 
	menu by the keystroke <b>Alt-underlined_letter</b> (e.g., to
	view the 
	menu options beneath the File menu you can either use the
	mouse to <em>click</em> on this menu, or use the keystroke
	command <em>Alt-f</em> or <em>Alt-F</em>. Note, that the
	cursor keys allow the user to move through the 
	<a href="Fl_menubuttons.html">menubuttons</a> once the focus
	is placed upon them.) 
	<em> When examining the menubuttons, notice that the user can
	  directly enter the name of a task to be excuted (or search
	    for an appropriate ftool) by using the keyboard binding
	    <b>Ctrl+t</b> to access the  
	  <a href="Task_selection.html">Task selection window</a>.</em>

      <hr>
      When the PACKAGES button is activated, a list of FTOOLs packages
      will be displayed, with a check button next to each one. [Note:
      Pressing the PACKAGES button again will remove the package list.]
      <p>
	<center><IMG SRC="flaunchp.gif"></center>
      <p>
	Once a package is selected, e.g. xte, than a list of all of
	the tasks within the selected package is displayed. [Note:
	Pressing the TASKS button will remove the list of tasks from
	the window.] 
      <p>
	<center><IMG SRC="flaunchpt.gif"></center>
      <P>
	The user can select any of these tasks, or can select another
	package to view the tasks which are contained within that
	package. Once the user has selected a task, by placing the
	cursor over that task and clicking the right most button a
	brief one-line description of the task appears in the <em>help
	line </em> at the bottom fo the flaunch window. Also a "Go"
	button will appear which will "execute" this task. (Since the
	"Go" button is not displayed in blue, it is truly a button and
	as such can be executed via the keystroke "Ctrl+g".) So if the
	user were to select the ftool <b>saextrct</b> than the flaunch
	window would change to appear as:
      <p>
	<center><IMG SRC="flauncht.gif"></center><br>
	Note that "double clicking" the right most mouse button on a
	task "executes" this task as well. 
<hr>
      After selecting the task and creating either an 
      <a href="Interactive.html">Interactive Window</a> or a
      <a href="Par_edit_window.html">Parameter Editing Window</a>,
      I depressed both the PACKAGES and the
      TASKS buttons to make this window smaller.<br> 
      <center><IMG SRC="flaunchpts.gif"></center>
<hr>
<a name="Output"></a>
      After the task has been either submitted to run, or run
      interactively, a yellow 
      <a href="Executed_tasks.html">"Output"</a> button appears in the
      <b>flaunch</b> window. (A Ctrl+o will "activate" this button
      from within this window.)<br>
