    <body>
	<center><h1>Explanation of the Menu buttons in the Flaunch window</h1></center>
      
	<P>
	  We will take a moment to go over the three menubottons in
	  detail. 
	<hr>
	<a name="File"><b>The File menu:</b></a>
      <p>
	If the user selects the <b>File</b> menu the following will be
	displayed: <br>
	<center><IMG SRC="fl_File.gif"></center><br>
	We see here that there are three options that can be selected,
	in which the first two carry out specific operations.
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Select a Task</b> (accessible via the keystroke
	<b>Control</b> key and <b>t</b> key pressed simultaneously)<br>
	  This command will create a  
	<a href="Task_selection.html">"Task selection"</a> window
	  which contains an entry box in which the user can type the
	  task name, e.g. fdump, any standard command, e.g. ls *.log, 
	  or a pattern matching string, e.g. *hist*. 
          (For more information about this behavior see above.)<p>
	  <li><b>Browse files</b> (also accessible via Control-b)<br>
	  This option creates a <a href="File_selection.html">"File
	    selection"</a> window, which allows the user to select and
	  view files, using the fits-viewer "fv".<p>
	  <li><b>Create a `Custom' package</b> (also accessible via
	    Control-u)<br>
	    This command allows the user to create a custom package,
	    list which, when the option 
	     <a href="#Options_custom_package"><b>Read in `custom'
		package list if one exists?</b></a> is set, will read
	    in that custom package list. This allows the user to
	    create a custom package which contains all of the FTOOLS
	    which are most used allowing greater ease in executing
	    these tasks. When this event is activated a window appears
	    which will contain
	      <a href="List_of_selected_items.html">the selected
	      tasks</a> (chosen by depressing the
	    right-most-mouse-button over the taskname that is wished
	    to be added). This window allows the user to write these
	    tasks to a file which will be read in each time flaunch is
	    activated in the future, if the proper "option" is
	    selected. (For more information on
	      <b>Creating a Custom package</b> see the 
	    <a href="Custom_package_creation.html">associated
	      documentation</a> <p>
	  <li><b>Change default directory</b> (also accessible via
	    Control-d)<br>
	    This command allows the user to change the default
	    directory that flaunch is pointed to. When this event is 
	    activated a window appears which will allow the user to
	    <a href="Directory_selection.html">select a directory</a>
	    and wll then change to that directory and use it as the
	    default for any farther work that is performed. The user
	    would have to chose this option again to change the default 
	    directory. 
      </ul>
      <p>
	<a name="Quit"><b>The Quit menu:</b></a>
      <p>
	The second option
	within the File menubutton is to "Quit", which from the arrow
	is a menu of its own:<br> 
	<center><IMG SRC="fl_File_Q.gif"></center><br>
	Here we are presented with a number of options as well as a
	list of keyboard short-cuts which are bound within the Flaunch
	window. We see that depressing the Control key and the "x" key
	simultaneously (or depressing the Control key with the "c"
	key) will "Exit all", i.e., exiting the entire process,
	killing all running processes and deleting all log-files that
	were created. This is the global "kill" command. However the
	user is also presented with several alternatives to this, the
	user can close all windows and delete all log-files but leave
	any processes submitted running in the background (Ctrl+p), or all
	windows can be closed and all processes terminated but the log
	files will be left for observation (Ctrl+l), or the user can simply
	close all windows and leave the log files as well as any
	processes which were submitted which haven't finished running
	in the background (Ctrl+w), or the user can simply iconify the
	window (Ctrl+i). 
      <hr>
      <a name="Options"><b>The Options menu:</b></a>
      <p>
	  If you are going to be setting many options, there is a
	  "tear-off" line at the very top of the menu. If you select
	  this the menu will appear as a separate window which does
	  not go away after an option is selected. Thus the user can
	  select all options and than save the settings to the
	  configuration file. Note that because this is a separate
	  X-window feature you will have to "close" this window via a
	  separate X-window command, i.e., Tcl/Tk cannot close this
	  window you will have to do that with your windowing system. 
      <p>
	If the user selects the <b>Options</b> menu from within the
	"flaunch" window the following list
	of options will be presented. This shows the user's initial
	setup before any modifications are made. The user should
	examine the following explainations and tailor flaunch to
	behave in a manner most suited to their particular needs. The
	initial (default) options display looks like:<br>
	<center><IMG SRC="fl_Options.gif"></center><br>
	These options all relate to the 
	<a href="Par_edit_window.html">parameter editing window</a>
	which is displayed "if" the task selected has a parameter file
	associated with it.
	<ul>
	    <a name="Options_flaunch_taskname"></a>
	  <li><b>Use specified shell rather than Bourne shell?</b><br>
	    This option tells flaunch to read the file
	    ~/.flaunch/shell_choice. This option works in conjunction
	    with the command <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#choose_shell"><b>Choose a new shell for command execution.</b></a>
	    If this option is set but no corresponding file exists 
	    flaunch will display an error message:<br>
	    <center><IMG SRC="set_shell_option.gif"></center><br>
	    Flaunch will then unset this option and save the current
	    option configuration to the .flaunchrc file. Under normal
	    circumstances this should not happen, it is only when
	    files are removed out from under flaunch that this
	    problem may occur. If this problem
	    reoccurs than execute the corresponding command,
	    <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#choose_shell"><b>Choose a new shell for command execution.</b></a>
	    <p>
	  <li><b>Use specified log-directory?</b><br>
	    This option tells flaunch to read the file
	    ~/.flaunch/log_file. This option works in conjunction 
	    with the command <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#choose_log"><b>Specify a new log-file directory.</b></a>
	    In the unlikely event that this option is set but no 
	    corresponding file exists 
	    flaunch will display an error message:<br>
	    <center><IMG SRC="set_log_option.gif"></center><br>
	    Flaunch will then unset this option and save the current
	    option configuration to the .flaunchrc file. Under normal
	    circumstances this should not happen, it is only when
	    files are deleted out from under flaunch that this
	    problem may occur. This error message will only appear
	    once, as flaunch will unset the option. If this problem
	    reoccurs than execute the corresponding command, 
	    <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#choose_log"><b>Specify a new log-file directory.</b></a>
	    <p>
	  <li><b>Turn off 'flaunch taskname' special
	      behavior?</b>:<br>
	    This option controls the behavior of "flaunch" when it is
	    called with a task specified, e.g., "flaunch saextrct". If
	    this option is NOT selected than the "flaunch" acts as a
	    <a href="Par_edit_window.html#Comand_call">one-shot
	      calling routine</a>. That is to say that it will
	    allow the user to edit the task's parameter file, if one
	    exists, or simply spawn the tool in the window in which
	    flaunch was called so that all input and output goes to
	    and comes from that original window. However <b>if this
	    option is selected</b> than "flaunch" operates in its full 
	    GUI mode allowing the user to run and control multiple
	    processes from within the "flaunch" window. If the task
	    specified exists as an FTOOLS task, then a 
	     <a href="Par_edit_window.html">parameter editing window</a>
	    will appear, if the "task" is actually a "Perl script"
	    or and "unknown command" than an 
	     <a href="Interactive.html">"interactive window"</a> is
	    spawned in which that command is executed. If the command
	    is a Perl-script this allows the user to respond to all
	    prompts, if it is any other command all output from that
	    command will be displayed in that window, and the log of
	    all output is available via the
	      <a href="Flaunch.html#Output">"Output" button</a> in the
	    <a href="Flaunch.html">"flaunch"</a> window. <p>
	      <a name="Options_custom_package"></a>
	  <li> <b>Read in `custom' package list if one
	      exists?</b>:<br>
	    This option tells "flaunch" to read in and display a
	    <b>custom</b> buttton in the PACKAGES list, is the file
	    $FLAUNCH_CONFIG/custom_tasks exists. [Note: FLAUNCH_CONFIG
	    is a directory created in the user's $HOME directory which
	    contains all of configuration files. Normally the default
	    directory created is ".flaunch" so that under normal
	    circumstances this file resides in $HOME/.flaunch, however
	    this may be configurable at some point in the future. <p>
	    <li> <b>Associate each Executed Task name to an 
	      Output Log?</b>:<br>
	    This option tells "flaunch" that rather than having one 
	    <a href="Executed_tasks.html#output_log">Output Log window</a>
	    to which any selected
	    <a href="Executed_tasks.html">executed tasks</a> are to be
	    displayed, a different window is to be created for EACH
	    output log selected for display. Note: The name of the
	    Output Log window will have the name of the selected
	    executed task selected. This allows the user to compare
	    the results of multiple runs. This behavior can be toggled
	    on and off with the use of this option. In general it is
	    best to leave this option turned off and toggle it on when
	    necessary - this avoids the proliferation of windows.
	    Remember a "Ctrl+c" in any window will destroy that window,
	    so removing windows if easily done.<p>
	    <li> <b>Read/write/use command-line construction
	      information?</b>:<br> 
	    This option tells "flaunch" to read in and use any
	    information stored in the file "taskname.clf" which is
	    located in the $HOME/.flaunch directory. This information
	    can be changed by using the option 
	    <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#control_command"><b>Control
		command-line construction?</b>:</a> and selecting or
	    deselecting the command-line usage boxes displayed in the
	    <a href="Par_edit_window.html#Command">"Parameter Edit Window"</a>
	    to the left of the parameter entry box,
	    the user can control the command-line which is constructed
	    when the task is called. Note that if this option is
	    set, the values of the command-line usage boxes are
	    stored in a file, "taskname.clf", 
	    and will be used whenever that task is called, even if the
	    user turns off the option to display the control-boxes. If
	    this option is turned off, the default, than all
	    parameters are used in constructing the command-line
	    call. 
	<hr>
	  <li> <b>Show Hidden parameters?</b>:<br>
	    Using this option the user can opt to see all
	    <a href="Par_edit_window.html#Hidden">Hidden</a>
	    parameters (these are the parameters that are usually
	    hidden from the user and not prompted for).<p>
	  <li> <b>Create Help buttons for each parameter?</b>:<br>
	      This option is set by default and will display a small
	      <a href="Par_edit_window.html#Default">"help" button</a>
	      next to each parameter displayed. If this button is
	      pressed than the <a href="Extended_help.html">"Extended
		Help" window</a> is displayed with the pertinent
	      section of the help displayed. Thus if the user only
	      wants to view the help that is pertinent to this
	      particular parameter, for this particular task than
	      pressing this button will display it. <p>
	  <li> <b>Show Comments on right?</b>:<br>
	    Using this option the user can control
	    which side the prompting string appears on - the default is on
	    the left since this seems to be the most natural place for
	    the prompting string, however since some users may want
	    the string on the other side an 
	     <a href="Par_edit_window.html#Comment"> option to place
	      comments on the right</a> was added.<p>
		    <a name="control_command"></a>
	  <li> <b>Control command-line construction?</b>:<br>
	    Using this option the user can also control the 
	    <a href="Par_edit_window.html#Command">command-line</a>
	    which will
	    be constructed from the parameter file. If this option is
	    selected then a series of "checkbuttons" appear next to each
	    parameter, the default is that all parameters will be specified
	    within the command-line which will be constructed, but sometimes
	    a truly experience user will want to control this. [<em>The novice
	      user should leave this option turned off! </em>]<p>
	  <li> <b>Do NOT iconify task_window?</b>:<br>
	    Using this option the user can control the default
	    for the "RUN" command, which is to iconify the task_window
	    created in which the task is executed. Since the user can
	    examine all output to this window from the 
	  <a href="Executed_tasks.html">Output Log</a> the executing
	  task window 
	  generally just clutters up the user's desktop, however as some
	  people like to "watch" the output scroll by (although they will
	  not have a scrollbar within the window) this is
	  configurable. All output generated can be viewed by selecting
	  the proper log-file from within the 
	  <a href="Executed_tasks.html">"Executed Tasks"</a>
	  window
	  which is activated by depressing the "Output" button which
	  appears in the main Flaunch window. Once an executed task is
	  selected the user can view the output log, and even kill the
	  associated process if they determine that something is not as
	  they wish. The 
	  <a href="Executed_tasks.html">Output Log</a>
	  window allows the user to scroll
	  back through ALL output and input which was received by the
	  <a href="Terminal.html">"terminal task window"</a>. 
	  The output log is the preferred method for examining all
	  output as the user can leisurely examine the results of all
	  executed tasks. <p>
	<li> <b>Keep Parameter Edit window open after
	    executing?</b>:<br> 
	  Using this option the user controls if the
	  <a href="Par_edit_window.html">Parameter Edit window</a>
	  remains open during execution. [Note: This option is only
	  available if flaunch is executed in its "environment" mode.]<p>
	<li> <b>Pause terminal window before deletion?</b>:<br>
	  Using this option tells Flaunch that it should "pause" the 
	  <a href="Terminal.html">"terminal task window"</a> (if it is
	  opened and displaying output to the screen) before
	  deleting it after the executed task is complete. The pause
	  will only last for 10 seconds, to allow the user to see the
	  status of execution, i.e., to see if the task exited
	  cleanly. For more information the user is reminded that all
	  output generated and 
	  displayed to the "Terminal task window" can be
	  viewed by selecting the proper log-file from within the 
	  <a href="Executed_tasks.html">"Executed Tasks"</a>
	  window
	  which is activated by depressing the "Output" button which
	  appears in the main Flaunch window. Once an executed task is
	  selected the user can view the output log, and even kill the
	  associated process if they determine that something is not as
	  they wish. The 
	  <a href="Executed_tasks.html">Output Log</a>
	  window allows the user to scroll
	  back through ALL output and input which was received by the
	  <a href="Terminal.html">"terminal task window"</a>. 
	  The output log is the preferred method for examining all
	  output as the user can leisurely examine the results of all
	  executed tasks. <br>
      <hr>
      <li> <b>Use Netscape to display on-line help?</b>:<br>
	Using this option the user can control which HTML
	browser to use to examine the on-line Help for Flaunch. The
	default is to use the Itcl's built in "Hyper-help"
	utility. Unfortunately, this browser has several serious
	flaws which can affect some of the links which are
	present. (The most serious of which is the inability to
	follow tags within HTML files.) However, Netscape can also
	be used to browse the on-line help. Netscape fully supports
	all of the HTML features that are present.<p>
	  When Netscape is first spawned within Flaunch, it simply
	  executes Netscape upon the selected HTML file - allowing
	  Netscape to determine if other Netscape processes are
	  executing and displaying the appropriate warning. However,
	  each subsequent call will determine if Netscape is still
	  executing and if so, it will use that window for
	  subsequent HTML help displays. <br>
      <hr>
      <li><b>Attempt to uncompress files automatically?</b><br>
	This option allows the user to specify that all file related
	windows should attempt to uncompress any selected files
	automatically. Otherwise the files will be returned as is -
	and left to the associated tool to handle. Note: This will
	usually result in an ERROR and the tool will abort, since no
	standard Ftool checks for compression. So it is suggested 
	that the user leave this option set. At present the two
	windows that will automatically uncompresses selected files
	before returning them to the calling routine are the
	<a href="File_selection.html">"File selection"</a> and
	<a href="List_of_selected_items.html"> "List of Selected
	  Items"</a> windows. The initial setting is to attempt to
	uncompress all compressed files. Note that this utility uses
	"gzip" to perform all uncompress operations - thus the user
	must have "gzip" in their path. Files that end in .gz, .z, or
	.Z are all allowed, at present gzipped tar-files, and
	tar-files in general are NOT supported at this time.<p>
      <li><b>Double-1 in File Selection window calls fv?</b><br>
	This option allows the user to specify that when the 
	<a href="File_selection.html">"File selection"</a> window is
	displayed, if the user clicks the left-most-mouse-button
	(Button-1) twice then "fv" is activated rather than having the
	filename returned - which is the default binding for
	      Button-1. 
      <hr>
	<a name="choose_shell"></a>
	<li> <b>Chose a new shell for command execution.</b><br>
	  This causes the 
	  <a href="Choose_a_shell.html">Choose a Shell window</a>
	  to be displayed. The user can select a new shell that is
	  used to execute commands entered into the 
	  <a href="Task_selection.html">Task Selection window</a>
	  which are not FTOOLS tasks. Thus if a user commonly uses the
	  C-shell and has customized commands in his .cshrc file, he
	  can choose to use the C-shell for executing any commands
	  entered into the "Task Selection" window. The results of
	  these commands will be written to the appropriate
	  log-file. The result of this command is stored in a file
	  $HOME/.flaunch/shell_choice, if this file is removed "sh" is
	  used for all command executions.<p>
	    <a name="choose_log"></a>
	<li> <b>Specify a new log-file directory.</b><br>
	  This command causes the 
	  <a href="Directory_selection.html">Directory Selection window</a>
	      to be displayed. The user can chose any directory and
	      have all Log files written to that directory. The
	      default is to write them to the users's $HOME/.flaunch
	      directory, but this is over-ridden by using this
	      option. This information is stored in the file 
	      $HOME/.flaunch/log_file which is used if it exists. Once
	      this option is set, it can only be changed to another
	      directory by selecting this option again.<p>
      <hr>
      <li> <b>Reset all options to their initial defaults.</b><br>
	    Note that this does NOT change the previously defined
	    shell, or log-file directories. However, it does restore
	    all displayed "Options" to their default values. To save
	    this the user must explicitly do so by selecting the
	    "save" option.<p>
      <li> <b>Restore options from configuration file.</b><br>
	   This option read the setting from the configuration file
	      which was previously saved - allowing the user to
	      recover from having reinitialized the options to their
	      default settings.
	<p>
      <li> <b>Save settings to configuration file?</b><br>
	The final option is not really an "Option" but an action,
	with the use of this the user can "Save" these setting to an 
	initialization file (<b>.flaunchrc</b>) which Flaunch will
	use to configure itself to the user's personal preferences. 
      </ol>
      <hr>
      <a name="Help"><b>The Help menu:</b></a>
      <p>
	If the user selects the <b>Help</b> menu the following list
	of options will be presented:<br>
	<center><IMG SRC="fl_Help.gif"></center><br>
      <ol><li> <a href="Extended_help.html"><b>About chosen
	      task</b></a>:<br> 
	  If the user has selected a task, and opts to receive help about
	  that task using this option, an 
	  <a href="Extended_help.html">Extended Help</a> 
	  window will appear in which the result of an "fhelp taskname" is
	  performed. [Notice the keyboard bindings that are available in
	  the "flaunch" window, i.e., Ctrl+h will cause the 
	   <a href="Extended_help.html">Extended Help</a> window to be
	  displayed, Ctrl+f will cause the "Help" for Flaunch to be
	  displayed, and Ctrl+o will cause a 
	  <a href="Topic_list.html">Topic list</a> to appear.]
	<li> <a href="aboutFlaunch.html"><b>About flaunch</b></a>:<br>
	  If the user selects this option then a browser is called,
	  this can be either the default Itkwish hyperhelp browser, or
	  Netscape depending on if the user has selected to use
	  Netscape to display the on-line help, in the
	  <a href="#Options">Options</a> menu. This help describes and
	  explains the usages of flaunch, as well as all of its present
	  abilities. [This us bound to the keyboard option <em>Ctrl+f</em>.]
	<li> <a href="Topic_list.html"><b>All topics
	      available</b></a>:<br> 
	  This option displays a list of all on-line help information
	  pertaining to <b>flaunch</b>. This is simply a list of all
	  hyper-links available. [Notice that typing <em>Ctrl+a</em>
	  will also cause this window to appear.]
