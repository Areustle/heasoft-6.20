      The "terminal window" is of limited usefulness since it does not
      have a means of scrolling backwards to examine output that has
      scrolled out of the window. Since this is a function of the
      Expect package it is unlikely that this will be fixed anytime
      soon. However, the user can use the 
      <a href="Flaunch.html#Output">Output button in the flaunch window</a>
      to display a list of <a href="Executed_tasks.html">executed tasks</a>
      from which the appropriate task can be selected and an 
      <a href="Executed_tasks.html#output_log">output log</a> of all
      information can be viewed. The output log contains an up to date
      list of all output that has been sent to the "terminal window"
      for the selected task. Thus any information that has scrolled
      out of that window can be examined in the "output log".
