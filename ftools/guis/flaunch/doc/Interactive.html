      <center><h1>Interactive Window</h1></center>
      <p>
	In the following example, the Perl script <b>chantrans</b> was
	selected (entered) as the Ftool to be run. Since this FTOOL
	has no parameter file that can be edited, then it is assumed
	that the tool is actually a script which required interactive
	input. Thus an interactive window is created and the tool
	given is executed within that window. It should be noted that
	this window will disappear immediately following the completed
	execution of the command. (Eventually, this behaviour will be
	a configurable option.) However, the user can examine all
	input and output by pressing the 
	<a href="Executed_tasks.html#output_log">Output button</a>
	button which appears in the main Flaunch window when a command
	is executed.<br> 
      <center><IMG SRC="int_term.gif"></center>
	<p>
	Note, no scrollbar can be placed within the interactive
	window which is created, it is a feature of the Expect
	package and adding a scrollbar has not yet been implemented
	within the package.
