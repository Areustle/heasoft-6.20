  <body>
	<center><h1>Creating a Custom Package</h1></center>
	The standard package list within "flaunch" looks like: 
	<center><table> 
	  <caption><h4>
	</h4></caption>
	<td> 1.)    <td>  <IMG SRC="flaunchp.gif"> <td>    <td> 2.)  <td>    <IMG SRC="flaunchpt.gif">  <tr>
	</table></center><p>
	Selecting any given package above results in seeing all tools
	within that packages (2.), a user may want to create a
	<em>Custom</em> package which contains only the tasks that
	they use most often. This can be done from within the 
	 <a href="Flaunch.html">"flaunch window"</a> using the 
	 <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#File">File
	  menubutton</a> and selecting the "Create a
	`Custom' package" option (or by striking Ctrl+u
	anywhere in the flaunch window). Several things will
	happen at this point, if the "flaunch window" isn't
	fully open, i.e., both Packages and Tasks aren't
	being displayed, they will be as can be seen in 2.)
	above (although the default "package" selected is
	"all").  In addition to this a
	  <a href="List_of_selected_items.html">"List of
	  Selected Items" window</a> will appear, 3.). This will
	also cause a binding between the right-most-mouse-button
	(Button-3) used to select a task or a group of tasks
	in the "flaunch" task-list and the "List of Selected
	Items" window that appears. So the user can use the
	"flaunch" window to display various tasks from
	various packages, and by clicking on them with
	Button-3 have them appear in the "List of Selected
	Items" window. If the user should make a mistake and
	wish to remove an item all that is required is to
	select that item within the "List of Selected Items"
	window with Button-1 (the left-most-mouse
	button). It will be removed from the list automatically. Once
	the user is satisfied with the tasks displayed in
	the list, the user can opt to save this list to a
	file - explained below.
	<p>
	<center><table> 
	<caption></caption>
<td> 3.)    <td>  <IMG SRC="custom_package_creation1.gif"> <td>    <td> 4.)  <td>    <IMG SRC="custom_package_creation2.gif">  <tr>
	</table></center><p>
	 Thus, if we create a "List of Selected Items" as
	 shown in 3.) below, when the 
	  <a href="List_of_selected_items.html#File">"File"
	   menubutton</a> is selected in the "List of 
         Selected Item" window, and the "Save list to
	 File?" option is selected, a file is created in
	 $HOME/.flaunch with the name "custom_tasks", the
	 "List of Selected Items" window is destroyed, and
	 the "flaunch" window is updated as shown in 4.) to
	 reflect the addition of the "custom" package, and
	 will show what is listed within that file. 
	 [Note: For this display to be shown on start-up
	 of "flaunch" the user will have to select the
	 appropriate option, i.e., 
	  <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#Options_custom_package"><b>Read in `custom' package list if one exists?</b>:</a> ]
<p> 
	Once this option is set subsequent calls of "flaunch" will
	automatically display the custom package button,
	the user can select their own "custom" 
	package and have it displayed so that they can
	easily activate these tasks. Successive creations
	of a "custom" package will overwrite previously
	created custom-task list.
