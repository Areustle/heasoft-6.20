      <center><h1>Helpful Hints<br> and<br> Suggestions for Flaunch</h1></center><p>
	  If you are connected to the network in some way, AND are
	  using Netscape to view this HELP page, than you can follow
	  <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xte/ftools/flaunch/Up_to_date_info.html">this link</a> 
	  for the most up-to-date information on Flaunch. 
<p>
	  Flaunch is meant to be a complete data analysis environment,
	  allowing a 
	  user to customize many of its features for their particular
	  taste and the way in which they operate. Unfortunately,
	  sometimes problems occur. This document is meant to help
	  with some of the more common questions that have cropped up
	  during the development of this tool. In many cases more
	  detailed discussions are presented on various pages, but
	  usually people do not want to spend their time trying to find
	  things, so this page was created. 
<p>

	  The majority of problems occur due to a lack of information,
	  which may cause a conflict to arise when the tool attempts
	  to operate in their particular environment. Older versions
	  of the Linux operating system have many problems with
	  permissions - which MUST be correct for Flaunch to
	  function. Specifically within the /dev directory, the world
	  as well as group MUST have priveleges to write to
	  <em>null</em> (i.e., /dev/null), also the world needs
	  priveleges to write to all tty*'s and ptty*'s. There are
	  also problems with several libraries, but you will know if
	  you have that problem because you would not be able to get
	  Tcl installed. Some of these problems only crop up under
	  certain circumstances, but if you get a message from Flaunch
	  it is invariably due to either a conflict in the users
	  environment, or a problem with the operating system's
	  installation. (Note this only occurred in Slackware 3.0 to my
	  knowledge but I no longer use the Slackware distribution.)

<h2>The problem with Mouse Buttons</h2>
	Tcl, in which Flaunch is written, allows the programmer to
	bind any keystroke to any action desired. This is most
	commonly used to create a "short-cut" so the user does not
	have to use the mouse to select a button or a
	menu-option. Flaunch uses binding throughout. Usually there is no
	problem with these binding which are only active in specific
	regions defined 
	by the programmer, however, sometimes the user has bound
	a specific mouse buttons defined to some action by their
	window manager. This can cause a problem when used with
	Flaunch. The most common problem occurs with the usage of
	Button-3 (or the right most mouse button). If this causes a
	problem, the user can use Shift-Button-3, or Control-Button-3
	and Flaunch will understand those as well. Thus if there is a
	conflict with any mouse button, the user should try holding
	down the "Shift" or "Control" key when pressing a mouse
	button.
