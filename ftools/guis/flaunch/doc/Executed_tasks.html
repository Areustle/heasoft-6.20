<p>
	The first window which appears [A.)] contains a list of ALL
	tasks which have been executed, or are still running in the
	background. Once the user selects one of the tasks displayed,
	as is displayed in B.) a "View log" button appears. If the
	user either clicks on this with the right mouse button
	  (Button-3) or uses 
	the keyboard binding short-cut (Ctrl+v) than an 
	<a href="#output_log">Output Log</a>	window is
	displayed. [See "Output Log Window" information.] <p>
	  If the user selects the "Action" menubutton (remember all
	  menubuttons are always in blue), either by selecting
	  it with Button-1, or using the "Alt+a" hot-key binding, he
	  will see the menu-list:
	 <center> <IMG SRC="executed_tasks_action.gif"> </center></center>
	  From this list the user can either "clear the window", i.e.,
	  delete all of the presently displayed log files from the
	  window and the disk, reinitialize the count to zero (Ctrl+d), or
	  close the window (Ctrl+d). The former option is particularly useful
	  if the user has run many FTOOLS successfully and the
	  "Executed Tasks" window is getting cluttered. By selecting
	  this option using Button-1 (or using the Cntl+d hot-key
	  binding) the user can remove all *_tcl_*.log files displayed
	  in the window from disk and reinitialize the count back to
	  zero.

      If the selected task is still executing then the "Output Log"
      will display everything that has been written to the log-file up
      to this point in time. The user will also notice that there are
      two buttons in the upper right corner, the "Kill" button (bound
      to Ctrl+k) and the "Update" button (bound to Ctrl+u) which will
      "kill" the process which is still executing in the background,
      or "update" the Output Log with the latest up to the moment
      information. Once the task either completes or is killed then
      the header lines:<p>
      <center>
	  ***** Process still executing *****<br>
	  This will be a partial log<br>
	  Press the Update button to update.<br>
	  --------------------------------------
	</center><p>
	will disappear and the log will appear as in B.

      <center>B. <IMG SRC="output_log2.gif"></center><p>
	If other tasks are selected from the 
	<a href="#executed_tasks">"Executed Tasks"</a> window than the
	<a href="#output_log">Output Log</a>	window is updated with
	the information from the appropriate log file.
