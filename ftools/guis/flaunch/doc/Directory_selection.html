	  The Directory Selection window is basically a smaller
	  version of the <a href="File_selection.html">"File
	    selection"</a> window, but it only displays directories
	  which exist. The user must select one of these directories
	  before flaunch can change into the selected directory. There
	  is one major difference between the Directory Selection
	  window and the File Selection window (other than some
	  options missing), and that is that the OK button MUST be
	  used to return the appropriate directory to the calling 
	  procedure, double-clicking
	  with Button-1 of your mouse will take you to that directory
	  so that you can see what is in that directory. This allows
	  the user the same ease of movement without hindering the
	  functionality of the window. <p>
	  Note: The Directory Selection window and the File Selection
	  window rely upon the same procedures, as such they cannot
	  co-exist at the same time without the potential for
	  posible conflicts arising. Thus the window is destroyed and
	  recreated each time it is called. This should not be a
	  problem is the user is calling this window as intended.
	  This window should be called, and used immediately after its
	  creation before the user moves on to other things. <p>

	  The Help menu button is the only one which has multiple
	  options, the File menubutton only contains the close option,
	  and the OK button (accessible by Ctrl+o) returns the
	  selected item to the calling routine. The Help button allows
	  the user to view more information on the window, i.e., this
	  window, or will display all available information.
