      <center><h1>List of Selected Items Window</h1></center>
      <center><IMG SRC="making_a_list.gif"></center> <br>
      The "List of Selected Items" window first appears as simply a
      blank window. During its creation several bindings are made to
      various mouse buttons when the focus is in a specific
      window. Since the "List of Selected Items" window can be
      associated with ANY listbox and has to operate closely with the
      parent window in which that listbox is contained, the mouse
      bindings which are defined allow the two listbox's (the one in
      the "List of Selected Items" window, and the one in the calling
      window) to be intimately associated. 
      <p> 
	  It is important for the user to realize that while in the
	  following example we are talking about the "File selection
	  window" the SAME mouse bindings are made in ANY window which
	  calls this procedure, and the listbox associated with this
	  window is the listbox in the calling window. 
      <p> 
	For conveniences sake we will assume that the "List of
	Selected Items" window is associated with the 
	 <a href="File_selection.html">"File selection window"</a>. So
	when the "List of Selected Items" window is first created it
	binds the right-most-mouse-button (from the calling listbox)
	to populate the "List of Selected Items" window. Thus if in
	the "File selection" window the user points at a file, and
	presses the right-most-mouse-button the name of the file will
	appear in the "List of Selected Items" window. (See below.)<p>

	<center><IMG SRC="making_a_list2.gif"></center><br>
	We see that the full path has been prepended to the filename
	that was selected - please note that the
	left-most-mouse-button in the "File selection" window remains
	associated ONLY with the "File selection" window, and only
	when the right-most-mouse-button is pressed in the "File
	selection" window, does the filename 
	get added to the "List of Selected Items" window. (Note the
	the user can also keep this button depressed and drag the
	cursor to select multiple files - they are added upon release
	of the button.) If the user
	wished to remove an item from the "List of Selected Items"
	window, all that is necessary is to press the
	left-most-mouse-button when over the item that is wished to be
	removed. (Note that the user can also keep this button
	depressed and drag the cursor to de-select multiple files -
	they will be removed upon release of the button.)<p>
	Thus the user can creat a list of items (in the above case
	these items are filenames and their associated paths). <br>
      <center><IMG SRC="making_a_list3.gif"></center><p>
	Once the user has a list of selected items then the user can
	turn to the Menubottons which are available to manipulate this
	list.

      <a name="File"><b>The File menu:</b></a>
      <p>
      If the user selects the <b>File</b> menu the following will be
      displayed: <br>
      <center><IMG SRC="making_a_list_File.gif"></center><br>
      We see here that there are two options that can be
      selected. 
      <ul>
	<li><b>Save list to File?</b> (also accessible by pressing
	  Control-s):<br>
	  This option allows the user to save the selected items to a
	  file. However, the behavior differes depending upon how the
	    <b>List of Selected items</b> window was called, and as a
	    result what exactly is being stored in the file being
	    created. Thus what happens at this point 
	    <b>may</b> be:
	    <ul><li> given the option to 
		 <a href="List_of_selected_items_dialog.html#filename_list">enter a filename into a dialog box</a> . 
	      <li> be returned to the calling window, with
		<a href="List_of_selected_items_dialog.html#task_list">a special file</a> 
		having been created for flaunch's usage only.<p>
	    </ul>

	<li><b>Cancel</b> (also accessible by pressing Control-c):<br>
	  This option closes the "List of Selected Items" window, and 
	  unbinds the associated mouse-keys. 
      </ul>
     <br> 
      <hr>	

     <a name="Help"><b>The Help menu:</b></a>
      <p>
      If the user selects the <b>Help</b> menu the following list
      of options will be presented:<br>
	<center><IMG SRC="making_a_list_Help.gif"></center><br>
	<ul>
	<li><b>About making a list</b> (also accessible by
	  pressing Control-h):<br>
	  This displays the on-line help window associated with the
	  "List of Selected Items" window, i.e., the hypertext
	  document you are presently viewing. <p>
	<li><b>All Topics available</b> (also
	  accessible by pressing Control-a):<br>
	  Displays the hypertext
	  help available on all Topics, i.e., a general INDEX
	  of available help pages for Flaunch are displayed,
	  allowing the user to select which windows or
	  behavior they wish to learn about. 
      </ul>
