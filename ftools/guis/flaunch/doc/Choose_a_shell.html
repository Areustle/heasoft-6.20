	  When the user has chosed to <b>Chose a new shell for command
	    execution. </b> from the "Option" menu in the Flaunch
	  window, this window is displayed. It reads the file
	  /etc/shells which contains ALL known/available shells on the
	  system that you are running flaunch. The default shell is 
	  "sh" or the Bourne shell. However, many users prefer the
	  C-shell (csh) or the T-shell (tcsh), and have these shells 
	  customized to their preference. Since the 
	  <a href="Task_selection.html">Task Selection window</a>
	  allows the user to enter ANY command as well as task names,
	  if the user chooses his shell, any personalized commands can
	  be typed into the "Task Selection window" and the log file
	  created will contain the result of the command issued. <p>
	  <center><IMG SRC="choose_a_shell2.gif"></center><p>
	  So choose one of the displayed shells by "clicking" on it
	  with the left-most mouse-button (Button-1), and selecting
	  "OK" or double-clicking on the chosen shell to choose it. 
	  After you have selected a shell, that is the shell that is
	  used when attempting to execute a command entered into the 
	  "Task Selection window". This shell will remain in effect
	  until another shell is chosen.
