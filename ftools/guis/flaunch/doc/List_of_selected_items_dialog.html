	    <a name="filename_list"><b>Creating a file with a 
	    list of Filenames:</b></a><br>
	When the user is attempting to create a file which will
	contain a list of filenames, an "Input Filename"
	window appears, which allows the user to enter a
	"Root-filename", i.e., a specific suffix will be appended to
	the name input. (In the above example case of a file
	containing filenames the suffix will be <em>".fil"</em>.) <br>
	<center><IMG SRC="making_a_list_input_filename.gif"></center><br>
	Once the user inputs a "root filename" the procedure will
	complete any necessary steps - in the above case, if the
	user has chosen the "<em>Attempt to uncompress
	  files automatically?</em>" option from the 
	 <a href="Flaunch.html">"Flaunch"</a> window's 
	 <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#Options">"Option"
	  menubutton</a> the code will attempt to uncompress any
	compressed files before writing the uncompressed filenames
	to the output file. Upon successfully completing this task
	the procedure will return the name of the output file which
	was just created to the calling routine. In the above case
	of the calling routine being the 
	 <a href="File_selection.html">"File selection" window</a> the
	output file will be returned to the appropriate Entry-box in
	the <a href="Par_edit_window.html">"Parameter Editing
	  Window"</a>. The code will automatically prepend an "at"
	[@] sign to the filename returned to the entry-box. Note:
	The user will have to examine the comment field to determine
	if this designation for a file containing a list of items is
	supported for the particular parameter entry-box. If not,
	the user will have to remove the "at" sign by hand.

	  <a name="task_list"><b>Creating a custom task
	      list:</b></a><br>
	  When the user has opted to creat a "custom" package which is
	  to be displayed by "flaunch" it is necessary that this file
	  have the proper format, and be stored in the proper place
	  with the proper name. Thus the file created has the name 
	  "custom_task" and resides in the ".flaunch" directory in the
	  users $HOME directory.
