<UL>
	<LI>The <b>File</b> menubutton allows the user to:
<UL>
	    <LI>"Hide the Hidden parameters" if
	      they are presently being displayed in the Parameter Editing
	      Window,
	    <LI>"Show the Hidden parameters" if they are not
	      being displayed in the Parameter Editing Window.
	    <li> <a href="File_selection.html">"File selection"</a>
	      allows the user to call up a "File selection" window
	      which shows all of the files in the present
	      directory.
	      <ul><li> When the user uses this option
		  any files selected are NOT associated with any
		  particular entry box! However the use can "select and
		  copy" a file name using the left mouse button, and
		  "insert" that into a particular entry box using the
		  middle mouse button.
		<li> When the user wishes to have the "file selection"
		  associated with a particular entry box, this is done
		  by:
		  <ol><li> Selecting the entry box within the 
		      <a href="Par_edit_window.html">Parameter Editing
			Window</a> using the left mouse button, or the
		      "tab" key which moves between them. 
		    <li> Use the right-most-mouse-button to call the 
		      <a href="File_selection.html">"File selection"</a>
		      window.
		    <li> Use the "OK" button within the window. This
		      will return the selected file to the entry box
		      selected. 
		  </ol>
	      </ul>
		    
	  </UL>
      </ul>

<ul>
	<LI> The <B>Run</b> menubutton allows the user to:
<UL>
	    <LI> "Execute" the task as per the default setting (i.e.,
	      <b>Do NOT iconify task_window</b>) which
	      was set in the <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#Options">Options</a> 
	      menu in the <a href="Flaunch.html">flaunch</a> window.
	    <LI> <a href="Terminal.html">"Execute in an open-window"</a>, 
	      i.e., the window which
	      is spawned will not be iconified so that the user can
	      see all output from the task being run. <em>[This is useful
	      if the user is running a task which requires interactive
	      input, e.g., <b>fplot</b>, or one that based upon the
	      user's desire can be made interactive based upon the
	      command-line created, e.g., <b>fdump</b>.]</em>
	    <LI> "Execute in an iconified window", i.e., the window
	      which is spawned will be iconified and all output from
	      the task can be viewed via the 
	      <a href="Flaunch.html#Output">Output</a> button in the
	      flaunch window which shows the 
	      <a href="Executed_tasks.html">Executed Tasks</a> window.

</ul>
<p>
      <center><IMG SRC="par_edit_Help.gif"></center><p>
	  <ul>
	    <LI> The <b>Help</b> menubutton allows the user to:
	  <ul><li>The <b>About the selected task</b> option will display
	      any <a href="Extended_help.html">Extended Help</a>
	      available on the task which is being displayed in the 
	      <a href="Par_edit_window.html">Parameter Editing Window</a>.
	    <li>The <b>Parameter edit window help</b> displays the
	      on-line help which is available to describe the features
	      of the 
	      <a href="Par_edit_window.html">Parameter Editing
			Window</a>.
	      <li> The <b>Other Topics available</b> option displays a
	      list of <a href="Topic_list.html">all topics which are
		available</a> for viewing via the on-line help. [This
		is also accessible via the Control-o keyboard binding.]
