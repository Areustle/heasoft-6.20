      <center><h1>Parameter Editing Window</h1></center>
      The <b>Parameter Edit Window</b> appears differently depending
      upon the <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#Options">Options</a>
      selected by the user if any, and how <b>flaunch</b> was
      called. If flaunch was called in its standalone/interactive
      environment setting, i.e., <b>flaunch</b> then the parameter
      editing window which appears looks like: 
<hr>
      <a name="Default"><b>The Default settings:</b></a> <p>

      <center><IMG SRC="par_edit_parhelp.gif"></center><br>
	  If no special options are defined by the user via the 
	   <a href="Fl_menubuttons.html#Options">Options</a> menubutton in
	  the Flaunch window, then the default settings are used. The
	  blue <a href="Par_menubuttons.html">menubuttons</a> (File,
	  Run, and Help) can all be accessed 
	  either via the keyboard binding Alt+underlined-letter or by
	  "clicking" upon the chosen menu. 
	<p>
	  The small <IMG SRC="par_edit_quest_mark.gif"> displayed next
	  to each "entry box" allows the user to display all available
	  help about this particular parameter for this particular
	  task in an 
	    <a href="Extended_help.html">"Extended Help" window</a>. All
	  information on parameters are in the "Extended Help"
	  window. This allows the 
	  user to read all available help on each parameter before
	  entering a value, thus removing any questions about what is
	  being expected by the task.
	<p>
	  The "entry box", i.e., the box in which the current value of
	  the parameter is displayed, is usually a small editing
	  window into which the user can type the desired command. 
	  (In cases where the input is Boolean - bool - the "entry
	  box" is actually a checkbotton taking on the value of "yes"
	  and "no" alternatively - removing the possibility of error.)
	  True "entry boxes" which allow the user to input values (any
	  data type except boolean) uses standard "Emacs" bindings for
	  moving around within the box.
	  (Control-a takes you to the beginning of the
	  entry, and Control-e takes you to the end of the entry). 
	  The user can also paste into the entry-box whatever is
	  high-lighted by the mouse via the middle-mouse-button 
	  (Button-2). The entry-box also allows the user to call the 
	   <a href="File_selection.html">"File Selection" window</a> by 
	  pressing the right-most-mouse-button, Button-3.<p>
	  <b>If you already have Button-3 mapped to something</b>, you can use
	  Shift-Button-3, or Control-Button-3 as well. Using Button-3 is the
	  preferred way to activate the "File Selection" window since
	  then all chosen files are unambiguously associated with a
	  specific entry-box. (The default is to return the output to
	  the First entry-box, if no entry-box is associated with the
	  calling of the "File Selection" window. However, if you have
	  previously selected an entry-box, and then chose to use the
	  "File Selection" window, any file chosen will be placed in
	  the entry-box that was chosen immediately prior to calling
	  the "File Selection" window. The "File Selection" window can
	  be chosen with the keystoke combination of Control-f when in
	  the "Parameter Editing Window", also note that the "File
	  Selection" window is then associated only with that
	  particular parameter editing window, until a file is
	  chosen. Of course the user could use the "high-light" and
	  "paste" method to paste files into any parameter window that
	  is open.)
<hr>
      <a name="None"><b>With Everything turned off:</b></a> <p>
      <center><IMG SRC="par_edit_none.gif"></center><br>
	  This setting is for users who do not like having extra
	  buttons and options available, i.e., those who are used to
	  the standard XPI interface and do not want to make use of
	  the special options available under the "flaunch"
	  environment. 

<hr>
      <a name="Hidden"><b>The Hidden parameter setting:</b></a> <p>

      <center><IMG SRC="par_edit_hidden.gif"></center><br>
	  If the Hidden parameter setting is active then all "hidden"
	  parameters (i.e., those NOT normally prompted for since the
	  default setting is usually the optimal setting) are shown in
	  "red". This allows the user to see that these parameters can
	  normally be left to their default settings without any
	  problem. However, if the user changes these settings he
	  should have carefully read the on-line help describing what
	  these parameters do and how they do it as a careless
	  change to these setting can cause the tools to produce
	  output which accurately reflects what the user input, not
	  NOT necessarily what the user wants. 

<hr>
      <a name="Command"><b>The Command-control setting:</b></a> <p>

      <center><IMG SRC="par_edit_con.gif"></center><br>
	  The "checkboxes" to the right of the Entry boxes (the
	  fields which allow the user to input values) control the
	  construction of the command-line which actually calls the
	  associated Ftool. Thus if the checkbox is active (it is
	  red - the default) then that parameter included in the
	  command-line which calls the routine. If the checkbox has
	  been deactivated 
	  (by the user clicking on that associated checkbox) then that
	  parameter is NOT passed to the associated task. <p>
	  Generally, all parameters should ALWAYS be passed to the
	  Ftool being called. However, certain tools were written in a
	  manner which uses the presence of the 
	  parameter in the command-line calls to affect the behavior of
	  the tool. The worst offender is FDUMP and its "More"
	  option. Eventually such non-intuitive behaviour will be
	  removed by the construction of "configuration" files which
	  tell Flaunch which parameters to include in the command line
	  and which not to for the tools default behavior. However at
	  the present the user must do this. <p>

	  The novice user should NOT use this as the code will NOT
	  pass that parameter to the code in the command-line. This
	  can be useful, as in the case of FDUMP which uses the "More"
	  parameter to pause the program, however it can also lead to
	  undesired behaviour since if the user does not also change
	  the "mode" such that they are prompted for this value if it
	  is needed, the code will happily use what is in the
	  parameter file. Care should be used in using this option and
	  only the experience user of Ftools should ever use this
	  setting. 

<hr>
      <a name="All"><b>The Command-control, Parameter-help, and Hidden parameter settings:</b></a> <p>

      <center><IMG SRC="par_edit_all.gif"></center><br>
	  When all available options are chosen (except positioning
	  the comment-line on the right) the Parameter Editing window
	  appears as above. <p>

<hr>
      <a name="Comment"><b>The Command-control, Hidden parameter,
	    and Comments on Right  setting:</b></a> <p>

      <center><IMG SRC="par_edit_all_comments.gif"></center><br>
	  This screen shows what a Parameter Editing window looks like
	  in which the user has opted to see all hidden parameters, as
	  well as to have check boxes which control the command-line
	  construction. 
	<p>
	  This option allows "flaunch" to look like certain "pre-GUI"
	  tools which some users may have come to like. [Note: This
	  option combined with the special behavior invoked by
	  "flaunch taskname" (which can be turned off) allows
	  "flaunch" to exactly mimic the behavior of certain IRAF
	  tasks.] 

<hr>
      <a name="Command_call"><b>The Command_line calling window:</b></a> <p>
	If flaunch was called in its standalone/interactive
      environment setting, i.e., <b>flaunch saextrct</b> then the
      parameter editing window which appears (if both the Hidden and
	Command-control options were selected) looks like: 
      <center><IMG SRC="par_edit_command_line_call.gif"></center><br>
	You will notice that in this window, "Run" is a button
	(since it is NOT blue) and NOT a menubutton (which are always
	blue). This is because when the parameter editing window is
	called in this manner the user has opted to run it as purely
	as a parameter editor, thus losing the advantages of flaunch's
	complete environment. So when the "Run" button is pushed
	flaunch terminates, and runs the selected task with all IO
	going to the window in which flaunch was originally
	called. [Note: this behavior requires that /dev/tty* be world
	writable!]
