NAME
        a2source --  Lists the raw HED & MED rate files for a given  sky
    position.
    
    
USAGE

DESCRIPTION
    
        This  program generates lists of the raw rate HEAO-1 A2 raw data
    to     use as input in the A2LCURVE program.
    
        It  calculates the longitude of the sun at mid-orbit,  the  scan
    angle      at  which  the  A2   instrument   is   closest   to   the 
    source,  and  the      angular   separation   between   the   source
    and   the   centre   of  the     instrument response function at the
    scan angle of closest  approach.      From  these   calculations  it
    determines  the  days  (since  beginning  of     1977) for which the
    source was most likely  to  have  been   scanned.       Since   each
    observing  day  produced  one  or  more raw data files, each     raw
    data filename is given as :
    
        a2_xrate****{detector}_###.raw
    
        where **** is  the  raw  data  file  number  (accumulated  since
    1977   day     227,  the  beginning  of the mission).  {detector} is
    either the MED     or the HED detector.  ###  is either 128  or  512
    (indicating   whether      the data is accumulated in 1.28 second or
    5.12 second mode).
    
        Output        consists        of       2       listfiles       :     
    {srcname}_hedfiles.lis   and      {srcname}_medfiles.lis  where  the 
    first contains a list  of  the     HED   raw   data  files  and  the
    second  a  list  of  the MED raw data files.      The HEAO1 A2 HED &
    MED raw data files are available in the  HEASARC      HEAO1  A2  FTP
    area.
    
    
    
EXAMPLE
    
      To  generate listings for the HED and MED detectors for the source
      HD_193793 :
    
      a2source equinox=1950 ra=304.6946 dec=43.6953 srcname=HD_193793
    
      this  will  produce  output   files   HD_193793_hedfiles.lis   and 
                                     HD_193793_medfiles.lis
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    equinox [real]
                 The  equinox  of  the input sky position (default value
        1950)
    
    ra [character string]
                 The source  R.A.  (hh  mm  ss.s  or degrees)
    
    dec [character string]
                 The source Dec.(dd mm ss.s or degrees)
    
    srcname [character string]
                 The source name.
    
    (dayfile) [character string]
                 The name and location of the  file  containing  mission
        day          numbers.
    
    (tchat = 10) [integer]
         Flag  to  indicate how chatty the task is at execution. A value
        of 10  is  the   default,  with  lower/higher  values  producing
        quieter/verbose  output   respectively.  This  is  for  TERMINAL 
        chattiness.
        
        (lchat = 10) [integer] 
              Same as above but for  the  level  of  chattiness  to  the
            output log file.
        
        (clobber=yes) [boolean] 
              Flag to overwrite output list file if it already exists.
        
        (mode = "ql") [character string]
