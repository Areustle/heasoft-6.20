 DESCRIPTION 

      For a given input sky position, this script finds the appropriate OSO8 
      raw rate file which include data for that input position. The filenames 
      of the selected OSO8 raw rate data are listed in output files.
      The script is intended to work only for the OSO raw rate data files 
      as stored in the HEASARC archive. Each file in the OSO8 rate archive 
      contains data for one day observation, obtained with the Cosmic X-ray 
      Spectroscopy experiments (A, B and C detectors).
  
      To determine the appropriate OSO8 raw data file, this script tests if 
      the input position is within the FOV of any of the detectors (A, B or C) 
      by computing the angle between the spin axis and that position.
      The maximum and minimum spin axis values for each day observation are
      read from a file (oso8spin.txt) distributed with this script. 
      The output files of this script list the filenames of the OSO8 raw rate 
      data that contain the input sky position. Since the A, B and C
      detectors viewed at any time different parts of the sky, there
      is an output file for each detector. These are named  
       {root}_a  for detector A
       {root}_b  for detector B
       {root}_c  for detector C
      where root is an input parameter. If requested
      there is also an output file for each detector listing the filenames
      of the OSO8 orbit data . These are named
       {root}_orb_a  for detector A
       {root}_orb_b  for detector B
       {root}_orb_c  for detector C
      where root is an input parameter.

      These output file are the input to
      'osorat' which extract a background subtracted and collimator corrected 
      lightcurve. The OSO8 raw rate data files are located in the HEASARC 
      OSO8 FTP area in the /oso8/data/gcxe/osorates directory.
      The sky position should be entered as right ascension and declination
      in decimal degrees, together with the corresponding equinox.

            
    FLAGS
       -h - Prints this help file

       the following flags require arguments
       -e - equinox [input any year i.e. 1950]
       -r - source R.A. [decimal degrees]
       -d - source Dec. [decimal degrees]
       -o - root of the output filename
       -c - require output orbit file lists ? [y/n]

    EXAMPLES 

        Find all the OSO8 raw rates data file for HD 193793 (coordinates 
        R.A.(1950)=304.6946, Dec (1950)= 43.6953) and list the filenames 
        in the outfiles with root name HD193793.  
        Also list the orbit files in outfiles with root name HD193793.
