 NOTE: The routine osophamake_a.f is not used in the code.
 However for future reference that can be added to extract spectra
 for the detector A. The routine need to be cleaned more.

 To add the detector A imply to change the following routines: 
 osopha.f   a test on detector number need to be add
            for detector A (iD as detector 0  b=1 C=2)
            call osophamake_a.f otherwsie for detecto B and C 
            (id as detector  b=1 C=2) call osophamake_bc.f

 osophagetpar.f change the detector range between 0-2 
                to allow for A detector selection
