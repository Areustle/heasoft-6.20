DESCRIPTION
    
    Osopha generates a broad-band lightcurve  and  a  1-63  channel  PHA
    spectrum  (neither one background-subtracted) from either the B or C
    detector, for a single source position.  The user  may  select  hard
    and  soft  channel  boundaries  for  the  lightcurve processing. The
    soft, hard, total counts  + the hardness ratio are then included  in
    the  output  lightcurve. The user may also select : (i)  to restrict
    the source data to within a certain phase (ii) to  perform  a  check
    for possible contaminating sources in the detector FOV.
    
    
    Note:
    
    * The output lightcurve and spectrum are normalized by 2/pi.
    
    *  If  the  user inputs previously determined background levels (for
    the  broad,  soft,  hard  energy  bands)  OSOPHA   can   produce   a 
    background-subtracted  lightcurve  (but  NOT a background-subtracted
    PHA spectrum).
    
    
    Determining the appropriate background correction -
    
    The background default values for broad, soft, hard energy bands are
    0.0  (set  as  hidden  parameters).  However  if  the user wishes to
    produce  a   background-subtracted,  broad-band  lightcurve  for   a 
    selected X-ray source, they must first:
    
    (i)  obtain a NEARBY position, which has also been observed CLOSE IN
    TIME to the selected X-ray source. This is  done  by  examining  the
    OSO-8  lightcurve  database  for  the  B/C  detectors located in the
    HEASARC OSO8BCLC archive.
    
    (ii) Once suitable positions have  been  found,  a  check  on  their
    lightcurve  profiles  should  reveal  a  `no  source'  candidate  (a 
    lightcurve which has a low, flat count-rate). This candidate may  be
    used as the background source.
    
    (iii)  Run the perl script OSOFINDFAST for these `background' coords
    to determine the days when the `background' is the the detector  FOV
    (the  `good'  observing days for the background). Also an ASCII file
    must be created containing  a list of all raw PHA  files  pertaining
    to the `good' observing days for the background.
    
    (iv)  Run  OSOPHA using the ASCII filelist of raw PHA data files and
    input the `background' coordinates.
    
    (v) OSOPHA will produce the output lightcurve for  the  `background'
    and  from this data up to 3 integral values (c/s) for the background
    may be determined: a mean broad band level; a mean soft  band  level
    and  a  mean  hard  band  level.  The 3 bands are bounded by channel
    boundaries which MUST be the  same  as  those  to  be  set  for  the
    selected X-ray source.
    
    The  above  integral  values may then be entered into OSOPHA (during
    the run for the selected X-ray source) as the  values  for  the  bg,
    bgl, bgh parameters respectively.
