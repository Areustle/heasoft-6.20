DESCRIPTION
    
     This task extracts background subtracted and  collimator  corrected
    lightcurves   from  the  OSO8  raw rate data obtained with the CGXSE
    experiment for a given   sky  position.  The  CGXSE  on  board  OSO8
    consisted  of  three proportional  counters (2 xenon,  1 argon). Two
    detectors (B and C) had fields of  view aligned with the  spin  axis
    in  opposite directions. The third,  detector A, is offset 5 degrees
    from the spin axis and is  located  on   the  same  side  as  the  B
    detector.  The fields of view (FOV) were 5, 3 and 5  degrees for the
    detectors A, B and  C  respectively.  The  B  and  C  were   pointed
    detectors,  instead A was a scanning detector.   The program uses as
    input the OSO8 raw  rate  data  files  as  stored  in   the  HEASARC
    archive.  Each  file  contains  one  day of data for the A, B  and C
    detectors. To select the OSO8 raw rate data file which most   likely
    includes  a  given  sky  position in the detector FOVs, users should
     run first the script 'osofindfast'. This determines which  detector
     viewed  a  particular  position  throughout the entire OSO8 mission
    and  outputs a file list of filenames, one  for  each  detector,  as
    input for  'osorat'.
    
     Only  lightcurves  for  one  detector  (A, B or C) can be extracted
    during   each  run  of  'osorat'.  For  a  given  detector  multiple 
    lightcurves  are  output   if a source position was observed several
    times during the OSO8 mission at  intervals  greater  than  a  week.
    The  output  lightcurve  excludes  data   detected  below  a default
    detector  collimator  response.  These  limits   are  set   in   the 
    parameters   'arlima',  'arlimb'  and  'arlimc'  for the A,  B and C
    detectors respectively in unit of cm**2.  Data  are  also   excluded
    if  an  overflow  is detected in the telemetry stream.   The default
    setting excludes telemetry records (~66 points of 160 ms  each )  if
    an  overflow  occurs in any of the detectors. Less restrictive  data
    filtering is  allowed  by  changing  the  parameter  'filter'.   The
     background  levels  (and errors) are set to fixed values, different
    for  each of the detectors, corresponding to the  nominal  detectors
    plus  sky   as  best  known.  These  values can be altered using the
    appropriate  parameters relative to each  of  the  detectors.    The
    time  resolution of the output lightcurves is 0.16 seconds. For  the
    detector A the program currently  does  not  account  for  confusing
     sources  included  in  the  A detector FOV during a spin revolution
    (~10  seconds), therefore it should be used with caution.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    equinox [real]
         Equinox of the input sky position (default value 1950)
    
    ra [string]
         The Right Ascension given in hh mm ss.s or degrees.
    
    dec [string]
         The Declination given in dd mm ss.s or degrees.
    
    detector [integer]
         Detector number. The program extracts lightcurves for only  the
         one  detector specified in this parameter. The parameter values
        are  1, 2 and 3 for the detector A, B and C respectively.
    
    filelist [string]
         The name of the file containing the list  of  raw  rates  files
         (listed as one filename per line). The file list can be created
         using the script 'osofindfast'.
    
    outfile [string]
         The root name for the  output  lightcurves.  The  program  will
        output  multiple   lightcurves  if  there is an interval greater
        than a week between  observations of the  source  position.  The
        lightcurves  are  named  by   adding  a sequential number to the
        'outfile' parameter starting from 1.
    
    (binspin) [boolean]
         Logical flag to indicate whether the user wishes the data to be
         binned  once  per spin revolution. By default this parameter is
        'no'  and the data are binned at 0.16 seconds. By  setting  this
        parameter  to   'yes'  the  data  are  binned  at  once per spin
        revolution, which  corresponds to about 10 seconds.
    
    (arlima=10.0) [real]
         Only data above the detector area limit set by  this  parameter
        are  included   in  the  output  lightcurves.  The area of the A
        detector is 263 cm**2  and the area limit is  currently  set  to
        10 cm**2.
        
    
    (arlimb=5.0) [real]
         Only  data  above the detector area limit set by this parameter
        are included  in the output  lightcurves.  The  area  of  the  B
        detector  is  76 cm**2  and the area limit is currently set to 5
        cm**2.
    
    (arlimc=50.0) [real]
         Only data above the detector area limit set by  this  parameter
        are  included   in  the  output  lightcurves.  The area of the C
        detector is 237 cm**2  and the area limit is  currently  set  to
        50 cm**2.
    
    (abkg=3.4) [real]
           Background  value for the A detector given as count per 0.160
        seconds.
    
    (bbkg=0.16) [real]
           Background value for the B detector given as count per  0.160
        seconds.
    
    (cbkg=1.6) [real]
           Background  value for the C detector given as count per 0.160
        seconds.
    
    (abkgerr=0.12) [real]
           Background  error  for  the  A  detector  for  0.160  seconds 
        integration time.
    
    (bbkgerr=0.008) [real]
           Background  error  for  the  B  detector  for  0.160  seconds 
        integration time.
    
    
    (cbkgerr=0.08) [real]
           Background  error  for  the  C  detector  for  0.160  seconds 
        integration time.
    
    (filter=1) [integer]
           Set  filtering  due  to  data  overflows.  The  values  range 
        between  1-4  with  the     following  meaning.  Filter  value=1 
        (default),  skip  an  entire record    of data if an overflow is
        detected for that record in  any  of  the     detectors.  Filter
        value=2,  skip  only  one  data point if overflow is    for that
        data point in any of the detectors.     Filter values  3  and  4
        skip  either  a  record  or a point if overflow    occurs in the
        detector for which the lightcurve is extracted.
