\chapter{The Lexington Benchmarks}
\label{sec:lexington}
\section{Introduction}

In May, 1994, the Lexington conference on photoionization modeling was 
held in order to better understand the differences between the various 
codes available for solving photoionization problems.  The conference 
was attended by approximately 8 modelers actively involved in the 
solution of problems involving H II regions, nova envelopes, planetary 
nebulae, and AGN clouds.  As part of the workshop the participants were 
asked to run several standard problems and compare the results.  These 
were chosen from what were thought to be representative models of H II 
regions, planetary nebulae, and AGN clouds.  The results will 
appear in a book on the proceedings of the Space Telescope Institute 
Conference on Emission Lines.  In this appendix we reproduce 
the comparison with the results of XSTAR 1.17 with the other models 
given in the conference proceedings, along with the input files needed 
to reproduce these results.  Note that version 1.17 has added an 
input command 'benchmark $n$', where $n$ is an integer from 1 to 8, 
representing the test case in the Lexington paper.  This command produces 
a table, similar to the 'print line\_fluxes' command, but also including the 
mean value and dispersion of each line flux from the ensemble of model results 
in the Lexington paper (with the results of the current run substituted for 
the XSTAR results given there; columns 5 and 6), the flux from the current 
XSTAR run (in the appropriate units asadopted by the Lexington conference; 
column 7), and the number of 'sigmas' the XSTAR result differs from the mean
(column 4).  The last line gives the summed $\chi^2$ for all lines from the 
10 codes represented in the Lexington paper.  The first two entries are always 
zero; the XSTAR $\chi^2$ is in the 4th non-zero column (column 6).
