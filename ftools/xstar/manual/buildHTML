#  Use latex2html to generate web pages from XSTAR LaTeX
#  documentation.  Always run LaTeX first to generate 
#  appropriate intermediate files and resolve references.
#  Main file is xstarmanual.tex.
#  Will also tar-up the resulting HTML for transfer to the 
#  web area.
#
#  Last generated with latex2html v98.1p1
#  Caveats:
#    This script is far from being idiot-proof.  There is no error-
#    handling, etc.  It is included in this package for the sake of
#    completeness.
