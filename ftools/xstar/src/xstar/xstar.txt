DESCRIPTION

     xstar is a tool  for calculating  the physical conditions and 
     emission and absorption spectra of photoionized gases.
     It may be applied in a wide variety of astrophysical contexts.  
     It is assumed that a spherical gas shell surrounding a central 
     source of ionizing radiation absorbs some of this radiation and 
     reradiates it in other portions of the spectrum.  xstar computes 
     the effects on the gas of absorbing this energy, and the spectrum 
     of reradiated light.  Other sources of heat may exist, for example, 
     mechanical compression or expansion, or cosmic ray scattering and
     xstar permits consideration of these effects as well.  The user 
     supplies the shape and strength of the incident continuum, the 
     elemental abundances in the gas, its density or pressure, and 
     its thickness.  The code returns the ionization balance and temperature,
     opacity, and emitted line and continuum fluxes.  These are stored as 
     fits files, with te exception of an ascii log file which contains 
     a slightly expanded version of the information sent to the screen.

     The user is urged to refer to the xstar manual, which is 
     available as part of the xstar source tree, or online at
     http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/xstar/xstar.html

PARAMETERS

     cfrac

          This parameter determines whether the geometry is a 
          complete sphere or covers only part of the continuum source.  
          In the former case, photons escaping the cloud in the 'inward' 
          direction are assumed to reenter the cloud at the inner edge 
          owing to the assumption of spherical symmetry. Default is 1.0.

     temperature   

          Define temperature, in units of $10^4 K$.  If the parameter 
          niter is set to 0 then the temperature is fixed at this
          value.  Otherwise the value is used as a first guess in 
          calculating the thermal equilibrium value.  If the pressure 
          is specified it is also used to calculate an initial guess at 
          the gas density, n=P/(kT), which is then used to calculate 
          Delta R_{max}=N/n.  Default value is 1.

     lcpres

          This parameter chooses between constant density (value 0) and 
          constant pressure (value 1).

     pressure

          Define model pressure in dynes/cm/cm.  Note that this quantity 
          represents the full isotropic pressure 
          (neutral atoms + ions + electrons + trapped line radiation) 
          instead of just the pressure due to hydrogen atoms and protons.  

     density

          Define model gas density, $n$.  This is actually the hydrogen nucleus
          density, so that, e.g., the total particle density in a fully-ionized
          plasma with solar abundances is $.3 n.  Units are cm$^{-3}$.  
          The default value is 1 cm$^{-3}$.  

     spectrum

          Define Spectrum.  Choices and formats are similar to those used 
          by XSPEC and include pow, bbody, brems and file

    spectrum_file

          If the `file' option is chosen for the spectrum type, you must 
          provide a text file of the spectrum in your current working 
          directory.  The first line of the text file must be the number of 
          energies listed in the table.  The remaining lines are the energy 
          channel (in eV) and the flux in units of 
          photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ erg$^{-1}$ or 
          erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ erg$^{-1}$.

     spectun

          The appropriate units for the spectrum file specified above 
          (1=photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ erg$^{-1}$, 
          0=erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ erg$^{-1}$). Default is 0

     trad

          This parameter pulls double duty, used to enter the radiation 
          temperature (in keV) in the case of a black body input model, or for 
          the power-law index in energy in the case of a power-law model. 

     luminosity

          Define model luminosity integrated between 1 and 1000 Ry.  
          Units are $10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$.  Default value is 1.

     column_density

          Define model column density, N.  Units are cm$^{-2}$.  

     rlogxi

          Define initial value of the log (base 10) of the 
          model ionization parameter.  If the density is
          held constant, the Tarter, Tucker, Salpeter (1969) form is used:
          xi = L/(nR^2).  If the pressure is held constant, a version of
          the Krolik, McKee, and Tarter (1981) form is used: 
          Xi = L/(4\pi c R^2 P).
