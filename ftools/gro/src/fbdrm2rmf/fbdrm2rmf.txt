NAME
    fbdrm2rmf -- Converts BATSE DRM file to RMF format
    
    
USAGE
    fbdrm2rmf drmfile rmffile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This utility converts a BATSE DRM file into an RMF  ("Redistribution
    Matrix  File")  that  is compatible with the XSPEC spectral analysis
    package.
    
    The output RMF files conform to the OGIP standard RMF format.  For a
    description  of  this  format,  see  George et al., "The Calibration
    Requirements for Spectral Analysis," in Legacy, No.  2,  pp.  51-64,
    November 1992.
    
    This is an outline of the output BATSE RMF FITS file format:
    
        Primary Array:  Null data array
    
        Extension # 1:  BINTABLE  'SPECRESP MATRIX'
                        Col    TTYPE       TFORM      TUNIT
                        ^^^    ^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^    ^^^^^
                          1    ENERG_LO    1E         keV
                          2    ENERG_HI    1E         keV
                          3    N_GRP       1I         none
                          4    F_CHAN      PI(126)    chan
                          5    N_CHAN      PI(126)    chan
                          6    MATRIX      PE(252)    cm**2
    
        Extension # 2:  BINTABLE  'EBOUNDS'
                        Col    TTYPE       TFORM      TUNIT
                        ^^^    ^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^    ^^^^^
                          1    CHANNEL     1I         chan
                          2    E_MIN       1E         keV
                          3    E_MAX       1E         keV
    
    Conventionally,  RMF  files  are intended for use with corresponding
    "Pulse Height Analyzer" (PHA) files generated  from  the  associated
    BATSE  BFITS  files  by  the FTOOL fbbft2pha.  The corresponding PHA
    file is assumed to have the  same  name  as  the  RMF,  but  with  a
    matching-case  extension,  .pha  or  .PHA.  The expected name of the
    PHA file appears in the RMF keyword PHAFILE.
    
    For data types  that  include  measurements  by  multiple  detectors
    (MER,  e.g.) the DETNAM keyword in the output RMF file shows all the
    used detector numbers concatenated together  in  the  sub-instrument
    identifier   label.    The   response   matrices   are  summed  over 
    detectors.   The  input-side  photon  energy  edges  (ENERG_LO   and 
    ENERG_HI)  and  the  output-side  channel  energy  edges  (E_MIN and
    E_MAX) are averaged over detectors.
