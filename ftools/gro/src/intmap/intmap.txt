NAME 
    intmap -- Generates EGRET intensity and exposure maps.     
    
USAGE

DESCRIPTION   
    This program is an FTOOLs version of the  INTMAP  program  developed
    by  the  EGRET Instrument team. The "XView" interface of the origina
    program  has  been  replaced  with  the  standard   paramater   file 
    interface,  and  the  calibration database files (energy dispersion,
    sensitive area, and point spread  files)  are  implemented  as  FITS
    files   (the   original   program   used  architecture/OS  dependent 
    binaries).  Intmap  reads  and  EGRET  counts  map,  and   generates 
    exposure and intensity maps.      
    The  main computation effort involvedd is in generating the exposure
    map. This is accomplished by obtaining the appropriate pointing  and
    telescope  modes  from  an  (ascii)  exposure  history  file(s)  and 
    applying a sensitivity calculation for each  sky  bin.  Output  maps
    are  written into FITS image files in the same format as the Viewing
    Period Intensity map files available  from  the  CGRO  EGRET  public
    data archive e.g.     
    <ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/data/egret/high_level/phase1/pnt_0020/intens_vp0020_g002.fits.gz>     
    There  are  related  routines  in the FTOOLS repository, emapgen and
    eaddmap which are used to  construct  and/or  combine  EGRET  counts
    maps  for  user-selected subsets of the full mission database. Using
    these tools, incombination  with  intmap,  one  could  for  example,
    perform a detailed search for variable or transient phenomenon.     
    This  routine  can  be fairly computationaly intensive, depending on
    the input data. An additional requirement is  that  about  the  user
    have  about  150-Mb  of  disk  space  available  (on the disk volume
    pointed to by "tempfildir"), where several temporary files  will  be
    created during execution.

    Gamma-Ray Observatory mission please  refer  to  the  varoius  links

PARAMETERS 
    
    miscdir [string]         
        name of directory containing timeline file     
    datadir [string]         
        name  of directory containing catalog file, counts map, exposure
        history files, exposure map and scale factor files     
    calibdir [string]         
        name of directory containing FITS calibration files     
    tempfildir [string]         
        location to put temporary files  generated  during  the  program
        execution     
    outputdir [string]         
        name of directory for output files     
    cmapfile [string]         
        name of the input FITS counts map     
    expflag [integer]         
        indicates whether or not to use exposure map     
    
EXAMPLES    
    1)  Create  an  exposure  map and and intensity map for CGRO Viewing
    Period      806.5, energy range 002: intmap  cmapfile=counts_vp8065_g002
    tempfildir="./" expflag=0 data_dir'"my_egret_data_dir"     
    2)  Produce  an  exposure  map for a counts map generated by summing
    two Viewing period count maps with the "eaddmap" utility:  (same  as
    above, but substitute eaddmap counts map file).     
    
    
FILES NEEDED 
    EGRET   Count  map  files  and  exposure  map  files  (see  "expflag 
    parameter"),           can           be           found           in      
    <ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/data/egret/high_level/phaseN/...>
    They  should   then  placed  in "data_dir". For example, for mission
    phase 1, Viewing Period 4.0, energy range 002:     
    data_dir/counts_vp0040_g002.fits     
    data_dir/exposr_vp0040_g002.fits     
    data_dir/scale.factor.fits     
    
    In  addition,  the  (ascii)  expousre  history   file(s)   for   the 
    appropriate  Viewing  Period should be placed in data_dir. These are
    available   under   <ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/data/egret/>,  
    e.g. data_dir/exphst_v01p.0040     
    Also,   from  the  same  ftp  site,  one  should  obtain  the  ascii 
    "timeline" and "catlog" files, and deom the "calib" subdirectory  of
    that archive, the appropriate (FITS) calibration files, e.g.:     
    misc_dir/timeline     
    data_dir/catlog     
    calib_dir/edpfil01.fits     
    calib_dir/psdfil01.fits     
    calib_dir/sarfil01.fits
