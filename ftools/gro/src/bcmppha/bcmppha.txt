NAME
    bcmppha  --  Converts  a CGRO/BATSE TYPE II trigger file to a TYPE I
    pha file
    
    
USAGE

DESCRIPTION
    The BCMPPHA program makes source and background Type I PHA files, 
    which can be used with the XSPEC package for gamma-ray burst data 
    analysis, from BATSE Type II PHA files for trigger data. A BATSE 
    Type II PHA trigger file can be obtained from the BFITS file using
    the FTOOLS: "FBBFT2PHA". A TYPE II pha file contains one extension 
    with one or more spectra stored as rows. A TYPE I pha file contains
    only one spectrum in an extension. This task has two file modes, 
    Source, and Background. "Source" makes a source file and "Background"
    makes a background file. One needs to know the light curves to
    determine a source region and a background region. The light curve
    is displayed to help to determine a source region if plot_lc is set
    to be 'yes'.

    SUPPORTED FITS FORMATS
    
          Currently only the following OGIP standards are  supported  by
    this     task:
    
        HDUCLAS1/HDUVERS1   =  'SPECTRUM'/'1.*.*'              (commonly 
    also known as "PHAVERSN=1992a")
    
        HDUCLAS2 = 'TOTAL'/'NET'/'BKG'
    
        HDUCLAS3 = 'TYPE:II'
    
        HDUCLAS4 = 'COUNT'/'RATE'
    
    
    
    
PARAMETERS

        data_dir [characte string]            The name of data directory

        infile  [character  string]           The  name  of  the   BATSE 
        trigger Type II PHA file to be read.
    
        outfile  [character  string]           The  name  of  the  BATSE 
        trigger Type I PHA file to be written.
    
        filemode [character string]          The  conversion  file  mode
        to   be   used.  "Source"  makes  a source file and "Background"
        makes a background file so that they can be used with the  XSPEC
        package for the BATSE gamma-ray burst data analysis.
    
        list_lc  [character  string]         [Yes]  displays  the  light 
        curve in ASCII. Default is [No]. One needs  to  know  the  light
        curve  to  determine  a source region and a background region of
        the BATSE trigger data.
    
        plot_lc [character string]          displays the light curve on 
        screen to help one to determine a source region of the BATSE 
        trigger data.

        chan_start [interger]               start channel number 

        chan_start [interger]               stop channel number

        ns1 [integer]        If "Source" mode is selected for  filemode,
        this is the start spectra number for the source region.
    
        ns2  [integer]        If "Source" mode is selected for filemode,
        this is the end spectra number for the source region.
    
        nb1  [integer]         If  "Background"  mode  is  selected  for 
        filemode,  this  is  the start spectra number for the background
        region before a source region.
    
        nb2  [integer]         If  "Background"  mode  is  selected  for 
        filemode,  this  is  the  end  spectra number for the background
        region before a source region.
    
        nb3  [integer]         If  "Background"  mode  is  selected  for 
        filemode,  this  is  the start spectra number for the background
        region after a source region.
    
        nb4  [integer]         If  "Background"  mode  is  selected  for 
        filemode,  this  is  the  end  spectra number for the background
        region after a source region.
