DESCRIPTION 
    The ADDMAP program adds or subtracts 2 counts maps as  well  as  the
    corresponding   exposure  maps  and  stores  the  resulting  counts, 
    exposure and intensity maps  into  FITS  format  files.  Optionally,
    only  the counts maps may be generated if requested by the user. The
    program has the ability to add maps of different  sky  regions,  bin
    sizes,  and  coordinate  system (celestial, galactic,earth centered,
    instrument centered and others). The program may be used to  combine
    observations  of  the  same region for different viewing periods, or
    to produce maps of expanded regions such as  galactic  disk  or  all
    sky  maps.  The  option  to  subtract  is then useful when combining
    several regions by allowing to back up to a previous state and  make
    adjustments.      
    The  ADDMAP program generates the output counts map which is the sum
    of the 2 input maps as well as the program report on  a  disk  file.
    If  the  user  requests  for  the  intensity maps to be generated as
    well, then an exposure and an intensity  map  are  also  created  to
    correspond to the counts map with the same name format.     
    The  output  map has its own dimensions, bin size, coordinate system
    and grid as requested by  the  user.  It  assumes  the  same  energy
    levels  and  zenith  angles as the first input map and if the second
    map does not have the same values, a warning message is written  but
    the  maps  are  added  by  energy  level  index.  The output map may
    replace the first input map and by default has the same  parameters.
    The  output  file  name  is  counts.v+xxxx.gyyy  where  xxxx  is the
    viewing period number  of  the  first  map  and  yyyy  is  a  unique
    sequence  number  for  +xxxx. The + sign signify that the map is the
    sum of 2 maps. If the output map replaces the first input  map  then
    it also takes its name.      
    Program  report:  it  consists  of a program title, echo of the user
    input, header of the input and output files, value and  location  of
    the  maximum  bins  for  all maps, total bin counts etc. The program
    listing is found in file eaddmap.list under the current directory.     
    If a fitsio erroror other  error  has  occured  the  error  will  be
    recorded in this file and the program will terminate.

EXAMPLES 
    1.  The  example  below  will  add  the maps  counts.vp0040.g002 and
    counts.vp0400.g002 and put them in the file  counts.v+0040.g069.  It
    will  also produce exposure and intensity maps.  The maps will be in
    the celestial coordinate system, of a limited portion of the sky.
