As of October 27, 1999, this directory contains the code and
documentation for the new FTOOL bod2rmf.  This FTOOL creates RMF
FITS files in XSPEC format for BATSE occultation data (NHIS type).
The corresponding PHA files are created by the old FTOOL bod2pha.
The new FTOOL bod2rmf consists of the following files:  Makefile,
bod2rmf.f, bod2rmf.hlp, bod2rmf.parin, bod2rmf.txt, hbod2rmf.c and
inst_resp.fits.  The latter file contains data required by the
FTOOL, and should be placed in the refdata directory.  The output
file corresponding to the example given in bod2rmf.txt is also
here, VP231_lad0.rmf, along with VP231_lad1.rmf, the output file
for the same case except for Detector 1 rather than Detector 0.
