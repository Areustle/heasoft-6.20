DESCRIPTION
    This  utility  creates detector response matrix (in RMF FITS format)
    for to  be  used  BATSE  occultation  data  (NHIS  type),  or  other
    non-triggered  data  types.   A separate detector response matrix is
    required for each CGRO orientation (constant  within  a  given  CGRO
    viewing  period),  source  direction, and BATSE detector (LAD).  The
    response matrix is generated using LAD  matrix  integrator  software
    (Version  3.0).   For Earth occultation data, The corresponding (PHA
    FITS) spectral data files in  XSPEC  format  are  created  by  FTOOL
    bod2pha.  The  observation  start  and stop times, or alternitively,
    the CGRO Viewing Preiod  number  are  used  to  obtain  the  correct
    calibration  parameters.  If the viewing period number is specified,
    the spacecraft orientation (X- and Z-axis clestial coordinates)  are
    determined automatically.    
    The  FITS  file,  inst_resp.fits,  which  contains detector-specific
    response matrix data, is read in by this  utility  and  is  required
    for  it  to  function.  This file lives in /refdata. In addtion, the
    file "vp_list.fits", also found in that directory is needed  if  the
    "viewper" options (see below) is to be used.    
    The  BATSE  Earth  occultation database, and related information are
    availble   through   the   HEASARC,    or    on    the    web    at:

    clobber [integer]        
        indicates whether or not to overwrite the existing output files        
        
EXAMPLES
    1.  Create  the  BATSE  LAD  number 4 instrument response matrix for
    CGRO Viewing Period 2.0 (==0020). The  source  of  interest  is  the
    Crab, and the output file is to be named "Crab_VP0020_lad4.rmf".    
    bod2rmf  viewper=2  sradg=82.63 sdecdg=22.01 rmffil=Crab_VP0020_lad4
    ladnum=4    
    
FILES NEEDED
    The Viewing Period list file "vp_list.fits",is  also  required;  see
    <ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/>.   This  should  be  placed  in 
    data_dir/vp_list.fits.  Their  are  additional  calibration   files, 
    which  should  be transparent to the user, and are included with the
    FTOOLS distribution.    
    
MODIFICATIONS
    In earlier versions, the energy channel  boundaries  for  a  certain
    epoch  (TJD  10179 - 10464) were comuted incorrectly. This was fixed
    in April 2005 (but subsequent to the HEASOFT 6.0 release).
