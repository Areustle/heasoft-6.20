DESCRIPTION  
    
    Specmat  is  derived  from the EGRET team "spectral" program. It can
    be used to construct an approximate  detector  count  spectrum,  and
    accompanying  instrumental  response  matrix  for an EGRET point (or
    compact extended) source determination. The spectra  is  ouput  into
    an  PHA  type FITS file, which can be used by XSPEC, and manipulated
    by other  HEASARC  utilities.  Similarly,  the  response  matrix  is
    written  in  RMF format (although it is not a normalized RMF; rather
    it has already been convolved with the instrumentaleffective  area).
    Some  informatio required for the spectrum and response calculations
    will have been previously performed by the "like"  program.  Specmat
    reads  the exposure history file (ASCII) for the appropriate viewing
    period(s) to take into account the history of  the  EGRET  telescope
    modes  during  the  dtaa  accumulation  period, and the scale factor
    file (FITS) which accounts for changes in the detector  gas  quality
    over  the  course  of the mission. The user should bear in mind that
    the spectral resolution of EGRE T is coarse, on the order of  20-25%
    depending  on  signal-to-noise.  Thus, typically ~10 spectral energy
    channels  are  output.  In  practice,  only  powerlaw,  broken-   or 
    absorbed  powelaw  models  have  been resonably constrained by EGRET
    spectral measurement. However, the XSPEC compatible  output  formats
    facilitate  the  combination  of  EGRET  data with other high-energy
    data for global spectral modelling.

        name of directory containing timeline file     
    datadir [string]         
        name of directory  containing  catalog  file,  exposure  history
        files, like file and scale factor files     
    calibdir [string]         
        name of directory containing FITS calibration files     
    tempfildir [string]         
        location  to  put  temporary  files generated during the program
        execution     
    outputdir [string]         
        name of directory for output files     
    exphistfilebase [string]         
        base name used to create the exposure history file names     
    outputfile [string]         
        name of the output file     
    likefile [string]         
        name of the input like output file     
    scalefacfile [string]         
        name of the scale factors file     
    rmffil [string]         
        name of the output RMF file     
    objnam [string]         
        name of the output PHA file     
    evclass [integer]         
        event class parameter. deterimines which  categories  (in  terms
        of  the  reliability  of  their  reconstruction)  of EGRET spark
        shamber events are to be included. Typically this should  be  2,
        which leads to the inclusion of class A and B events.     
    clobber [integer]         
        indicates whether or not to overwrite any existing output files         
        
EXAMPLES  
    1.  Make  an  EGRET detector  spectrum (PHA file) and  response  matrix     
        (RMF file) for the Crab pulsar (phase averaged), for viewing period
        0.4  (i.e.  CGRO  commisioning phase).  The  point source  analysis     
        has been previously performed usling the like program. This results  
        in the ascii file depiected below.
