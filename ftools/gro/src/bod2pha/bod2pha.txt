DESCRIPTION
    This   utility   extracts   spectral    data    from     a     BATSE  
    Earth-occultation  FITS   file  (NHIS type), forms a summed spectrum
    and writes the output into  PHA  FITS  (i.e. XSPEC)  files.  A  time
    interval  in  Truncated  Julian  Date  (TJD  == JD-2440000.5) can be
    specified, advisably  within a CGRO viewing  period.  Alternatively,
    a  CGRO  viewing Period number can be provided; if this input option
    is used it overrides the TJD start/stop  fields.  The  CGRO  Viewing
    Plans  (or  observation  Timelines)  are  available on the web site:
    <http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/timeline/index.html>, or view  the  FITS
    file  $LHEA_DATA/vplist.fits.  Another  FTOOL, "groview", can proide
    useful information on  the  orientation  of   the  observatory,  and
    the  relative  illumination  of  the  individual  BATSE  Large  Area 
    Detector modules (LADs)  as  a  function  of   time   for  a   given
    celstial  source  position.  Note  that  each BATSE occultation data
    FITS file corresponds to a  single  astronomical   source   on   the
    sky.    The   name   of   each   output  PHA  file  defaults  to a s
    tring containing the start and  stop  Truncated  Julian  Dates,  and
    the   BATSE  LAD   ID  (ranging  from  0  through  7).   An optional
    string may be entered to allow shorter  output  file   names.    One
    output   file  is generated  for  each  detector  with  at least the
    specified minimum number of flux determinations for the source.  The
    related   tool,   "bod2rmf"  is  needed  to  create  the  associated 
    instrument response matrices.
    
    The BATSE Earth occultation database, and  related information   are
    availble    through    the   HEASARC,   or   on   the    web     at:  
    <ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/data/batse/occultation>;     also    
    see        <http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/batse/index.html>         and       
    <ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/data/batse/misc>. For a  complete
    description   of   the   methodology,   refer  to  the  BATSE  Earth 
    Occultation  Catalog   paper,   Harmon,   et   al   2004   ApJ   Sup 
    (astro-ph/0404453).
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    datadir [string]
        name  of  directory  containing  BATSE data occultation file and
        viewing period list file
    
    outputdir [string]
        name of directory for output files
    
    bodfil [string]
        name of BATSE occultation data FITS file (NHIS type)
    
    viewper [integer]
        viewing period number - user enters either  this  value  or  the
        tjdsta/tjdstp pair
    
    tjdsta [real]
        desired start time (Truncated Julian Date)
    
    tjdstp [real]
        desired stop time (Truncated Julian Date)
    
    minfds [integer]
        minimum  number  of  flux determinations by a BATSE detector for
        inclusion in summation
    
    srcnam [string]
        name of source for which BATSE occultation data  FITS  file  was
        created
    
    phastr [string]
        optional string to help name PHA output files
    
    clobber [integer]
        indicates whether or not to overwrite the existing output files
        
        
EXAMPLES
    1.  Create  a PHA spectral data files for the Crab, for CGRO Viewing
    Period  13.5.The  output  file  root  name   is   specfied   to   be 
    "Crab_VP315".  A  minimum of 4 flux determintations are required for
    an individual LAD to be included in the analysis.

FILES NEEDED
    
    BATSE   Earth   occultation   flux   history   files,    found    at  
    <ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/data/batse/occultation>,     then    
    placed in "data_dir", e.g. data_dir/crab_10150-10399_nhis.fits.  The
    Viewing  Period  list  file  "vp_list.fits"  is also required if the
    time boundaries are  to  be  entered  in  terms  of  viewing  period
    number.  By  default, this file resides in the $LHEA_DATA directory,
    and is obtained by bod2pha transparently.  Otherwise, obtain a  copy
    from  <ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/>. This should also then be
    placed   in   data_dir/vp_list.fits.    Other   files,    such    as  
    batse_obs_plan.fits,  which  contains  additional  details regarding
    the CGRO pointing history, can be obtained there as well.
