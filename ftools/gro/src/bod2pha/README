As of August 31, 1998, this directory contains the revised code and
documentation for the FTOOL bod2pha.  The new code includes an option
that allows the user to input a string to be used in the naming of the
output files.  A new routine, written in C, called namepha.c has been
introduced to do this (strings are difficult to manipulate in Fortran).
The following files have been revised: Makefile, bod2pha.f, bod2pha.hlp,
bod2pha.par and bod2pha.txt.  The wrapper, hbod2pha.c, has not been
changed, but is included in this directory for completeness.  I leave
it to the FTOOLS group to rewrite mkpkg to include namepha.c (I don't
know anything about IRAF).
