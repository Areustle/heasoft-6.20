NAME
    fevpbtoa  -- Converts Comptel EVP fits files to an ASCII file.
    
    
USAGE
    fevpbtoa fitfile frec nrec scal
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  utility  converts  Fits formatted COMPTEL EVP data files to an
    formatted ascii file.
    
    The input fits file is opened.
    The output ascii file "ascfit.evp" is opened.
    Beginning at "frec", "nrec" events are transferred to the ascii file.
    Application of column scaling factors is performed when scal = true
    and suppressed when scal = false.
    
    (The output structure is based on the routine  SEVPBTOA  written  by
    Rita  Freuder  at  the  University  of  New Hampshire, that uses the
    native data on a SUN computer.)
