DESCRIPTION 
    Emapgen  converts a photon list (qvp file) to a counts map. The data
    are  binned  according  to  the  event's  arrival  direction  in   a 
    rectangular  coordinate  system.  Finally  the  program  stores  the 
    binned values in a data cube  with the energy  level  as  the  third
    dimension.     
    An  ascii  file  called  the timeline file is required by this ftool
    and has been store in the CGRO refdata directory.   The  ftool  will
    automatically   pull   this   file.    The  timeline  file  contains 
    information on the state of EGRET (e.g. when the  instrument  is  in
    calibratin mode ect.)     
    Please  note  that  the  start  and  end time specifications for the
    desired ouput data set (map) MUST BE bracketted  by  the  start  and
    endpoints  of the input data set (Viewing Period event or QVP file).
    This is true irrespective of the choice of  input  time  coordinates
    (i.e. TJD or calendar date).

        This  variable  is  used  to  calculate  zenith  angle   cutoffs 
        eliminate  the  Earth's albedo.  If this number is zero the user
        inputs a series of maximum values for the  zenith  angle  either
        at the command line or interactively as the program runs.          
        If  albcut  is  non-zero,  it  is  used  to calculate the zenith
        cutoff angles.         
        For this case albcut is multiplied by an energy dependent  angle
        to  determine  the  zenith  cutoff.   The formula for the energy
        dependent  angle   can   be   found   in:   Thompson   D.J.   et 
        al.,1993,ApJS,86,629.

        albcut is set to zero a  value  for  ZENMAX#,  where  #  is  the
        number  of  the  level.   Emapgen will ignore any values set for

EXAMPLES 
    The example below will make a map from the photons in the fits  file
    qvp0160s.fits  and put the results in qvptes.fits. This run will not
    eliminate any photons based on the time  tag  on  the  photon.   The

         The example below is making a map of pulsar data.      
         The file, PVP0007A was produced by the program pulsar.      
         There will be no restriction on the points in terms of       
         binary phase, but only the photons that have a pulsar      
         phase between 0.5 and 1.0 will be used in the map.  Also     
         the user has placed a time range over in which photons      
         will be accepted (this has nothing to do with the pulsar     
          mode).
