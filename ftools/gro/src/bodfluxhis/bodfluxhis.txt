DESCRIPTION
    The  BODFLUXHIS  program  constructs  a  light  curve   from   BATSE 
    occultation  data  FITS  file  (NHIS  type), for user specified time
    intervals. The data are automatically screened on the basis  of  the
    one-bit  quality/status  flags  contained  in  column 21 of the flux
    history table. Data are displayed in  the  form  of  Flux  and  flux
    uncertainty  vs. time (in TJD). Displays are made to the screen or a
    printable graphics file. The data can also  be  saved  to  a  simple
    ASCII  file.  This   will  be useful for example, for data selection
    for spectral extraction using the "bod2pha" routine. In addition,  a
    simplified   FITS  light  curve  file  can  be  produced  as  output 
    (covering either the selected  viewing  period  range  or  the  full
    contents  of  ths  input  file(s). This FITS light curve can then be
    analyzed in more detail using the XRONOS temporal analysis package.
    
    A CGRO viewing Period number can be obtained by ftool bodgetvp,  and
    ignore  the decimal point, take integer. For instance, take 805.5 as
    8055. Alternatively, just examine the first table extension  of  the
    file  $LHEA_DATA/vp_list.fits,  or view the CGRO timeline on the WWW
    at <http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/timeline/index.html>.
    
    
    The  BATSE Earth occultation database,  and related information  are
    available    through    the    HEASARC,    or   on   the   web   at:  
    <ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/data/batse/occultation>     (also    
    see   <http://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/batse/index.html>).   A   complete  
    description of the BATSE Earth-Occultation analysis is given in  the
    ApJ Supplements article, Harmon, et al 2004 (astro-ph/0404453).
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    bodfil [string]
        The  name  of  BATSE  occultation  data  FITS  file (NHIS type).
        Either a file name or a file list start with a prefix @.
    
    vp [integer]
        A CGRO viewing Period  number  of  initial  view  period  to  be
        examined
    
    vp2 [integer]
        A CGRO viewing Period number of final view period to be examined
    
    binsz [integer]
        desired size of each bin in sample numbers
    
    outfil_dir [string]
        the directory to hold the log file and plot files
    
    data_dir [string]
        the  directory  to  hold  the input files, and the newly created
        Fits file
    
    fitsf [string]
        option to write a Fits file
    
    FitsFname [string]
        name of Fits file to be created
    
    fitsWtFlg [integer]
        flag to write a Fits file,  0  for  selected  #VP  data,  1  for
        overall data
    
    viewlog [string]
        optional string to help view of log file
    
    device [string]
        optional  string  to  display curve light plot. Either /xwin, or
        /ps, or /gif, or /jpg
        
        
EXAMPLES
    
    Display light curve from BATSE occultation FITs file from file  list
    "cygx-1.list"  with  binsz 2 and CGRO viewing periods 8090 and 8150.
    All the input files are put in the directory data_dir.
    
    This generates three output files:
    
    1. plot file: light curve vs. TDJ for either  selected  VP,  or  the
    input FITs,depending the selected options on a interactive men
    
    2.  A  FITs  file  "new.fits"  with light curve binary table will be
    generated if fitsf is set to be "yes".
    
    3. write the name of generated FITs file into  the  exist  log  file
    flux.log in the directory "outfil_dir"
    
    
    The parameter file input for this case would be:
    
    name of directory for data files:[]data
    name of BATSE occultation data file (NHIS type):[]@cygx-1.list
    the size of each bin:[]2 
    ID of initial viewing period:[]8090 
    ID of final viewing period:[]8150
    Do you wish to write a Fits file?(yes/no)[]yes
    name of Fits file to be created:[]new.fits
    0 for selected #VP data, 1 for over all data(0/1)[]0
    name of directory for logs:[]log 
    Do you wish to view a list of existing log file?(yes/no)[]no 
    name of device for ploting(/xwin,/ps,/gif)[]/xwin     
    
    FILES NEEDED
    
    BATSE    Earth    occultation   flux   history   files,   found   at  
    <ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/data/batse/occultation>,     then    
    placed  in  the  directory  pointed  to by the "data_dir" parameter,
    e.g. data_dir/cygx-1_10351-10470_nhis.fits. The Viewing Period  list
    file  "vp_list.fits" which is located in the $LHEA_DATA directory is
    also required.  Some  (optional)  related  files  can  be  found  in
    <ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/data/batse/misc>,            e.g.           
    batse_obs_plan.fits, in  that  directory  which  contain  additional
    details regarding CGRO's pointing history.
