NAME
    time2sec -- Calculate the number of seconds between  an  input  date
    and time and a reference date and time.
    
    
USAGE
    time2sec date time leapfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task calculates the time interval in seconds between the input
    date and time and the reference date and time. The result is written
    both  to  the screen and into the parameter file.  The dates must be
    of the form yyyy-mm-dd or dd/mm/yy (19yy only).  The time must be in
    the  form hh:mm:ss.ddd.  This task takes leap seconds after January,
    1970 into account.
    
    PARAMETERS
    
    date [string]
        The absolute date to be converted to an offset  time.   Must  be
        in  the  form yyyy-mm-dd or dd/mm/yy (19yy assumed).  Leading 0s
        ARE required.
    
    time [string]
        The absolute time to be converted to an offset.  Must be in  the
        form  hh:mm:ss.ss.   Single digits may be used, but at least a 0
        in each value is required.
    
    leapfile [string]
        The name of the file which contains a list of  leapseconds.   If
        FTOOLS  is  entered,  then  the  leapsec.fits file in the ftools
        refdata directory is  used.   If  CALDB  is  entered,  then  the
        current  LEAPSECS  dataset  in the Calibration Database is used.
        If the refdata directory or a Caldb is  not  available  at  your
        site,  then  a  leap  seconds file can be obtained via anonymous
        ftp  to  legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov:/caldb/data/gen/bcf/leapsec*.fits. 
        Please  note:  you  will  need  to  set up the Caldb environment
        before  accessing  the   Database.    See   your   local   Caldb 
        administrator for details.
    
    (datezero=1993-01-01) [string]
        The date from which the offset is calculated.
    
    (timezero=0:0:0) [string]
        The time from which the offset is calculated.
    
    (offset=) [double]
        The  output  time interval in seconds between the input date and
        time and the reference date and time.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.  Calculate  the  offset  in  seconds  from  1993-01-01  0:0:0  to
    1994-03-02  12:23:23.1  using  the  leapsec.fits file in the refdata
    directory.
