DEADTIME (Dec93)               ftools.time              DEADTIME (Dec93)



NAME
    deadtime -- Update the exposure of PHA file  by  deadtime  based  on
    GTIs
    
    
USAGE
    deadtime infile gtifile deadfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  updates  the exposure time of a file based on input GTIs
    and deadtimes.  The GTIs must be in one file, and time-orders,  such
    as  in  the  output  of  MGTIME.   The  deadtime file must contain a
    column for time and another for fractional deadtime.   The  deadtime
    is  assumed  to  apply  from  the  time associated with the deadtime
    until the time in the following row.  The  file  is  assumed  to  be
    time ordered.
    
    
    
NOTE: New options added in version 2.0 (May 1997)
    By  default  the  tool  looks  for  the  GTI  extension  as  another 
    extension of the infile. So, gtifile is now hidden parameter.
    
    Exposure keyword changed from ONTIME to EXPOSURE which is hidden.
    
    Entry for multiple MKF files added.   The  input  for  this  can  be
    either  a  list of MKF files separated by comma (,) or an ascii file
    containing the names of the files.  In the later case, one name  per
    line  of  the  ascii  file need to be entered and the ascii filename
    should be preceded by the sign '@'. The files in the list should be 
    arranged in the ascending chronological order.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        The name and extension for input PHA FITS files, containing  the
        keyword to be modified.
    
    (gtifile [filename])
        The  file  name  and  extension of the input GTI FITS file.  The
        file is assumed to be time ordered.  By default, it is  the  one
        of the extensions of the infile.
    
    deadfile [filename]
        The name and extension containing the deadtime information.
        If this starts with  a "@", then it  is assumed  to be an ascii file 
        containing a list of files (one filename per line). There should
        be no more than 32 files. The order of the files is important. They 
        should be arranged in the ascending chronological order.  

    (gtistart = "START") [string]
    
    (gtistop = "STOP") [string]
        Name of the column for stop times in the input GTI file.
    
    (exposure = "EXPOSURE") [string]
        The name of the keyword in the input PHA file to be updated.
    
    (timecol = "TIME") [string]
        The name of the time column in the input deadtime file.
    
    (deadcol = "") [string]
        The  name  of  the  fractional  deadtime  column  in  the  input 
        deadtime file.  This is either G2_DEADT  or  G3_DEADT  for  ASCA
        GIS2 and GIS3 respectively.
    
    (sensecase = no) [boolean]
        Whether to be case sensitive about column names.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.  Change the ONTIME keyword in the events file events.fits to reflect
        the deadtime as given in deadtime.fits, using the GTIs in the 2nd
        extension of events.fits
    
            ft> deadtime events.fits+1 events.fits+2 deadtime.fits
