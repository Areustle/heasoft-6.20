SEC2TIME (July 1998)           ftools.time          SEC2TIME (July 1998)



NAME
    sec2time -- Convert a  time  offset  in  seconds  relative  to  some
    reference date and time to an absolute date and time.
    
    
USAGE
    sec2time offset leapfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task takes a reference date and time and a specified number of
    seconds from that time and calculates the corresponding new date and
    time.   This  task  is  useful  for  interpreting  the  time  values 
    recorded in some FITS files which are  given  in  units  of  seconds
    relative to some start time.
    
    The  calculated date, time, and MJD are written both to the terminal
    and into the parameter file.
    
    This task takes leapseconds after January, 1970 into consideration.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    offset [real]
        The number of seconds from the zero date and time.
    
    leapfile [string]
        The name of the file which contains a list of  leapseconds.   If
        FTOOLS  is  entered,  then  the  leapsec.fits file in the ftools
        refdata directory is  used.   If  CALDB  is  entered,  then  the
        current  LEAPSECS  dataset  in the Calibration Database is used.
        If the refdata directory or a Caldb is  not  available  at  your
        site,  then  a  leap  seconds file can be obtained via anonymous
        ftp  to  legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov:/caldb/data/gen/bcf/leapsec*.fits. 
        Please  note:  you  will  need  to  set up the Caldb environment
        before  accessing  the   Database.    See   your   local   Caldb 
        administrator for details.
    
    (datezero= "1993-01-01") [string]
        The  reference date in yyyy-mm-dd or dd/mm/yy (19yy only) format
        from which the offset is calculated.
    
    (timezero= '00:00:00') [string]
        The reference time in hh:mm:ss.ddd format from which the  offset
        is calculated.
    
    (date) [string]
        The  calculated  absolute  date in yyyy-mm-dd format.  This is a
        task output parameter.
    
    (time) [string]
        The calculated absolute time in hh.mm.ss.ddd format.  This is  a
        task output parameter.
    
    (mjd) [real]
        The  calculated  Modified  Julian  Day  Number.   This is a task
        output parameter.
        
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   Calculate  the  absolute  time  which  is  86500  seconds  from 
    1993-01-01 00:00:00
    
            ft> sec2time 86500 FTOOLS
    
    The  calculated  time  and date are 00:01:40.000 on 1993-01-02.  The
    Modified Julian Day is 48989.0011574.
