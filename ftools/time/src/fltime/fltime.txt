NAME
    fltime  -- Filters a FITS table by selecting only the rows that have
    a time stamp within an specified set of time intervals.
    
    
USAGE
    fltime infile[ext#] gtifile outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task selects rows from in input FITS table and writes  them  to
    an  output  table if the time stamp for that row falls within one of
    an input set of "Good Time Intervals" (GTIs).
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The name and extension number in square brackets  of  the  input
        FITS  table  extension  containing  the  list  of  events  to be
        filtered.
    
    gtifile [file name]
        The name of the Good Time Interval  FITS  file  to  be  used  to
        filter  the  input  table.  This  is  a  FITS  table or bintable
        extension which contains 2 columns defining the start  and  stop
        times  of  a  set  of Good Time Intervals.  The column values in
        this table are given in units of seconds  relative  to  a  start
        time  specified  in the extension header (see the description of
        the obsdate and obstime parameters).
    
    outfile [file name]
        The name of the output  "filtered"  FITS  table  containing  the
        selected  events  from  the input file.  This table will contain
        the same number and order of  columns  contained  in  the  input
        table.   If the copyall parameter is set equal to 'no' then this
        FITS file will consist of a null primary  array  followed  by  a
        table  or bintable extension (depending on the type of the input
        extension).  If copyall equal yes, then the  primary  array  and
        any  other  extensions  in the input file will also be copied to
        the output file.
    
    (column = TIME) [string]
        The name of the column in INFILE that contains  the  time  stamp
        value  that is used to determine if that row falls within one of
        the input Good  Time  Intervals.   The  values  in  this  column
        should  be  in  units  of  seconds  relative  to  the start time
        specified by the obsdate and obstime keywords in the  header  of
        the extension.
    
    (obsdate = MJDREF) [string]
        The  name  of  the  keyword containing the reference date in the
        input events table.  The value can either be blank (or  "-")  to
        defeat  the  reference checking, in julian days or in 'dd/mm/yy'
        format.
    
    (obstime = ) [string]
        The name of the keyword containing the  reference  time  in  the
        input  events table in 'hh:mm:ss.ddd' format.  This parameter is
        only used if obsdate is in dd/mm/yy format.
    
    (gticols = START,STOP) [string]
        The name of the columns in GTIFILE  containing  start  and  stop
        times.
    
    (gtidate = MJDREF) [string]
        The  name  of  the  keyword containing the reference date in the
        input GTI table.  The value can either  be  blank  (or  "-")  to
        defeat  the  reference checking, in julian days or in 'dd/mm/yy'
        format.  It must have the same format as the obsdate parameter.
    
    (gtitime = ) [string]
        The name of the keyword containing the  reference  time  in  the
        input  GTI  table  in  'hh:mm:ss.ddd' format.  This parameter is
        only used if obsdate is in dd/mm/yy format.
    
    (exposure = EXPOSURE) [string]
        The name of the keyword containing  the  exposure  time  in  the
        input  and  output  FITS  file.  If the keyword doesn't exist it
        will be created.
    
    (copyall = no) [boolean]
        If YES, then the task will copy the primary array and any  other
        extensions from the input event file to the output file.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   Filter  the  second  extension in a FITS file named events.fits
    using a GTI file named gti.fits and place filtered  results  in  the
    FITS  file  out.fits.  All  other  parameters  take on their default
    values.
    
            ft> fltime events.fits[2] gti.fits out.fits 
    
    2.  Filter the first extension in  a  FITS  file  named  events.fits
    using  a  GTI  file named gti.fits and place filtered results in the
    FITS file out.fits. The COPYALL flag is set  to  yes,  thus  copying
    the  primary array and any other extensions in the input file to the
    output file.
    
            ft> fltime events.fits gti.fits out.fits COPYALL=yes
