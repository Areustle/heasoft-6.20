NAME
    burst -- Remove bursts of events from time ordered event list.
    
    
USAGE
    burst infile outfile tdelta keep
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  routine reads a list of time ordered events from the specified
    extension, and removes bursts of events from the list.  A  burst  is
    defined  as  any  events  within  tdelta seconds of the first event.
    The first event in each burst may optionally be kept  in  the  event
    list.   It is also possible to keep the bursts instead of the "good"
    counts.  The total number of bursts, events, the  total  burst  time
    and  the  minimum  time  between  events is written to the parameter
    file.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        The input FITS file name and extension.
    
    outfile [filename]
        The output FITS file name.  If preceeded by  a  !,  an  existing
        file of the same name will be overwritten.
    
    tdelta [real]
        The  maximum  time,  in seconds, between the first event and all
        subsequent events to define a burst.
    
    keep [boolean]
        Whether to keep the first event in a burst or  not.   For  ROSAT
        this should be true and for BBXRT it should be false.  Note that
        the value of the "good" parameter (below) does  not  effect  the
        action of this parameter.
    
    (good=yes) [boolean]
        Whether  to  keep  the  "good" events and reject the bursts.  If
        this parameter is  set  to  false,  the  burst  events  will  be
        written to the output file.
    
    (timecol=time) [string]
        The name of the column containing the time of the events.
    
    (copyall=true) [boolean]
        Whether  to  copy  all other extensions and the primary array to
        the output file.  Mission dependent header keywords  are  copied
        regardless.
    
    (totburst) [integer]
        The  total number of bursts identified in the data is written to
        this parameter on output.
    
    (toteve) [integer]
        The total number of  events  during  the  identified  bursts  is
        written here.
    
    (totime) [real]
        The total length of time of the identified burst events.
    
    (tmin) [real]
        The  minimum  time between events in the file is written to this
        parameter.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        If true, a file of the same name as the  requested  output  file
        will be overwritten.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   Remove  from  the  first extension of the file "input.fits" all
    burst events with a length of 2 milliseconds or  less,  but  keeping
    the  first  event  of  each burst, and write the results to the file
    "output.fits".
    
            ft> burst input.fits output.fits .002 yes
