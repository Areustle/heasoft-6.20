FKEYPAR (Jun92)               ftools.futils              FKEYPAR (Jun92)



NAME
    fkeypar  --   Read  the value of FITS header keyword and write it to
    the parameter file.
    
    
    
USAGE
    fkeypar fitsfile[ext#] keyword
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  reads  the value of a keyword  (in  the  header  of  the
    first  FITS extension, by default) and writes it as a string  to the
    'value' parameter  in  the  parameter  file.   The  keyword  comment
    string  is  also  written  to  the  'comm'  parameter.   Whether the
    keyword exists or not is written to  another  parameter.   See  also
    the ftkeypar task which performs a similar function.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    fitsfile [file name]
        The  name,  including  extension  and extension number in square
        brackets (e.g., myfile.fits[3]) of the input  FITS  file  to  be
        read.    If  no  explicit  FITS  extension  name  or  number  is 
        specified, then by default fkeypar will look for  the  specified
        keyword  in  the  header of the first extension of the FITS file
        (and not in the primary array header).
    
    keyword [string] 
        Name of the header keyword to be read. (The name  is  not   case
        sensitive.)
    
    (exist) [boolean]
        Whether or not the requested keyword exists.
    
    (value) [string]
        Returned value of the header keyword.
    
    (comm)  [string]
        Returned keyword comment string.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   Read  the  value and comment string of the NAXIS keyword in the
    3rd extension in the FITS file called 'myfile.fits'.
