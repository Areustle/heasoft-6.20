NAME
    flist -- Convert the contents of a FITS table to ASCII format.
    
    
USAGE
    flist infile[ext#] outfile columns rows
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task prints the information in the header and data  of  a  FITS
    table  extension  (either  ASCII  or binary table) into ASCII format
    which then may be displayed or printed.  This  task  is  similar  to
    the  XANADU program DUMPFITS, and performs much the same function as
    the FTOOLS FDUMP.  FDUMP is recommended for output  to  a  file,  or
    for  piping  into  other programs.  By default, flist will print all
    the rows and columns of all extensions as well  as  all  the  header
    records  to STDOUT (the terminal screen) or to an output ASCII file,
    but only selected information may be output  by  setting  the  input
    parameters  appropriately.   The  output  format is either a default
    format or specified with TDISPn keywords.
    
    This task is primarily designed to display FITS table extensions  to
    the  screen  and  currently it can only output the header records of
    the primary array or image extensions.   Use  the  fimgdmp  task  to
    output the data in a FITS image.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The  name  of  the  FITS  file  (and  extension number in square
        brackets or indicated by a +) to be converted.   If an  asterisk
        is  supplied for the extension number, or if no extension number
        is specified, then all extensions in the   FITS   file  will  be
        listed
    
    outfile [file name]
        The  name  of the output ASCII file.  If outfile = 'STDOUT' then
        the output  will  be  written  to  the  standard  output  device
        (usually  the  users  terminal)  rather  than  to  a  file.   If 
        preceeded by a !, an existing file of  the  same  name  will  be
        overwritten.
    
    columns = "" [string]
        The  names of all the columns to be listed in the output.  If no
        names are given (or a '-'), then by default all the  columns  in
        the  table  will  be output.  The column names must be separated
        by commas or spaces in the list.  If a column  name  contains  a
        space,  the  name must be enclosed in double quotes (").  If any
        names in the column list are  enclosed  in  double  quotes,  the
        entire  list must be enclosed in single quotes (').  eg '"column
        1",column2'
        
        Optionally the list of column names can be placed  in  an  ASCII
        file,  one  name  per  line,  and  then  the  name  of the file,
        proceeded by an "@" character may  be  given  to  the  "columns"
        parameter.   If the first non-white character in the column list
        is the negation character then  the  output  file  will  contain
        those columns NOT named in the remainder of the column list.
        
        The  'flcol'  task  (with  the  NLIST parameter set to 1) may be
        used to generate a list of column names suitable  for  input  to
        this task.
    
    rows = - [string]
        The  range  of  rows to be output.  The default of - means print
        all rows.  The first ten rows could be  specified  as  ROWS=1-10
        or  just  ROWS=-10.   To  print  the first ten rows and all rows
        from 900  through  the  last  (inclusive),  use  ROWS=1-10,900-.
        ROWS=1,3,7,23 will print only those four rows.
    
    (prhead = yes) [boolean]
        Should the header keywords be output?
    
    (prdata = yes) [boolean]
        Should the table extension data be output?
    
    (showscale = yes) [boolean]
        Whether  to  show the scaled values, or the actual values in the
        file.
    
    (skip = 1) [integer]
        This option allows the user to display only every nth row.   The
        default is for all rows to be shown.
    
    (tdisp = no) [boolean]
        The  parameter  controls  whether  the  program looks for TDISPn
        keywords for the format of the output.  If tdisp  is  true,  and
        no  TDISPn  keyword exists for the requested column, the default
        output format is used.
    
    (page = yes) [boolean]
        If true, and if the output is sent to STDOUT,  the  output  will
        be paged, so that user is prompted after every 24 lines.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        If  true,  an  existing file with the same name as the requested
        output file will be overwritten.
    
    more = yes [boolean]
        Whether to continue paging, or just quit at  this  point.   This
        parameter  should  not  be  entered  on the command line, and is
        only used for output to the screen.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.  List the contents of the FITS table 'junk.fits' to the terminal:
    
         ft> flist junk.fits STDOUT
    
    2.  List 'junk.fits', including only the columns  specified  in  the
    colnames.lis file.
    
         ft> flcol junk.fits nlist=1 outfile = colnames.lis
    
         ft> edit colnames.lis
            (Delete or rearrange the order of the column names)
    
         ft> flist junk.fits columns=@colnames.lis
    
    3.   Dump  only  the  first 100 rows of data in the 2nd extension in
    the file 'big.fits' to an output file 'big.dat'; do not  output  the
    header keywords.
    
            ft> flist big.fits+2 big.dat rows=1-100 prhead=no
    
    
BUGS
    FLIST  cannot  display  the  data  in  a FITS primary array or image
    extension.
    
    If the width of a scaled column in an ASCII table  is  less  than  8
    characters, the value cannot be displayed.
    
    Complex and Double Complex datatypes cannot be displayed.
    
    
    
SEE ALSO
    ftlist,  ftcreate. fv, the interactive FITS file editor, can also be
    used to view the contents of a FITS table.
