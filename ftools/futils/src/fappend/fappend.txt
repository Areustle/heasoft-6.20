NAME
    fappend  --  Append  an extension from one FITS file onto the end of
    another FITS file.
    
    
USAGE
    fappend infile[ext#] outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task copies a FITS extension (or primary array) from  one  file
    and  appends  it  to  the end of the output file.  If a FITS primary
    array is being copied then it will be  converted  to  a  FITS  IMAGE
    extension  in the output file.  If the 'pkeywds' flag is set to true
    then any optional keywords in the primary  header  are  copied  into
    the appended extension's header as well.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The  file  name  and  extension  number  of  the extension to be
        copied.  More than one file  and  extension  can  be  append  by
        specifying  @filename.   This  file  should  contain  a  list of
        filenames and extension, one per line.
    
    outfile [file name]
        The name of the FITS file to be appended to.
    
    (pkeywds = no) [boolean]
        If this  boolean  flag  is  set  to  'yes',  then  any  optional
        keywords  in the input file primary header will be copied to the
        extension header.  The following required keywords will  not  be
        copied:  SIMPLE, BITPIX,  NAXIS, and EXTEND.  This option should
        be used with caution since it can result  in  inappropriate,  or
        even  illegal  keywords  being copied into the extension header.
        This option has no effect if a primary array is being copied.
    
    (history=yes) [boolean]
        If this parameter is true, history records will be added to  the
        output file headers.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   Append  the  third  extension  from  the FITS file test.fits to
         the FITS file test1.fits and copy all  optional  keywords  from
         the primary header:
    
            ft> fappend test.fits[3] test1.fits pkeywds+
    
    2.   Append  the  first  extension  from  the FITS file test.fits to
         the FITS file test1.fits without copying the optional  keywords
         from the primary header:
    
            ft> fappend test.fits test1.fits
    
    3.   Copy  the  primary  array  from  the  FITS  file  image.fits to
         the FITS file data44.fits:
    
            ft> fappend image.fits[0] data44.fits
    
    4.  Append the files specified in the file append.lis  to  the  file
          out.fits
    
            ft> fappend @append.lis out.fits
