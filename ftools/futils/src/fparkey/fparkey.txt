NAME
    fparkey --  Write a parameter value to a FITS header keyword.
    
    
    
USAGE
    fparkey value fitsfile keyword
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  changes  the value of a header  keyword  (in  the  first
    FITS  extension,  by  default).   If the value of the task parameter
    'add' is "yes",  the task    allows a new keyword  to  be  added  to
    the  header,  otherwise,  attempting  to  add  a  new  keyword  will
    cause  an  error.  The data type of the keyword value is  determined
    implicitly  from  the keyword value.  The values of T, TRUE, Y, YES,
    F, FALSE, N, or NO (in upper  or  lower  case)  are  interpreted  as
    boolean  values.   Enclosing  the value string in single quotes will
    force it to be interpreted as a string, rather  than  as  a  numeric
    or boolean value.
    
    A  keyword  many  be  deleted  from the FITS header by prefixing the
    keyword name with  a minus sign (-).
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    value [string]
        Input  value  to  be written to the header keyword. (Strings are
        case sensitive.)
    
    fitsfile [file name]
        The  name,  including  extension  and extension number in square
        brackets (e.g., 'myfile.fits[3]') of the FITS file whose  header
        is  to  be  changed.   If  no  FITS  extension name or number is
        specified, this task will operate on the first extension  header
        (and not the primary array header).
    
    keyword [string] 
        Name  of  the  header  keyword to be modified, added, or deleted
        (The name is not  case sensitive).  To delete a keyword,  prefix
        the name with a minus sign (-).
    
    (comm = " ")  [string]
        The  comment  string to be written to the keyword.  If 'comm' is
        a blank string, then the existing  keyword  comment  string,  if
        any, will not be modified.
    
    (add = no) [boolean]
        Allow  new  header  keywords  to  be added?  If 'add = no', then
        existing keywords can take new values but no  new  keywords  can
        be added to the file.
    
    (insert = 0) [integer]
        Keyword after  which to insert the new  keyword.  All subsequent
        keywords  will be  shifted  down.  If  insert  consists only  of
        digits, the new keyword will be inserted at that position.  When
        insert is  blank or  has a  value of '0',  new keywords  will be
        appended to the header.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   Set  the  header  keyword  EXTNAME  in the 3rd extension in the
    'myfile.fits' FITS file to the  value  of  'RATEFILE',  leaving  the
    comment string unchanged.
    
         ft> fparkey RATEFILE 'myfile.fits[3]' extname 
    
    2.   Add  the  header  keyword  NEWKEY  to the primary header in the
    'myfile.fits' FITS file with a value of 15.25 and a comment of  'New
    keyword':
    
         ft> fparkey 15.25 'myfile.fits[0]' newkey comm='New keyword' add=yes
    
    3.   Delete  the  header  keyword XVALUE in the 1st extension of the
    data.fits FITS file:
    
         ft> fparkey dummy data.fits -xvalue
