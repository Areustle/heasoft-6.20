NAME
    fstatistic  --  Compute  statistics  (min,  max,  mean, etc..) for a
    given column in a FITS ASCII or binary table file extension.
    
    
USAGE
    fstatistic infile[ext#] colname
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task  computes  the  mean,  standard  deviation,  minimum,  and
    maximum  of  the data in the specified column.  The rows included in
    the calculation can be specified.  Maximum and  minimum  values  can
    be  specified, outside of which the data will not be included in the
    calculation.  If either the maximum and/or the minimum requested  is
    equal  to  INDEF,  it will not be tested for.  The output is written
    to STDOUT and to the parameter file  by  default.   The  output  may
    also be directed to a file.
    
    Note  that in the case of vector columns, statistics are computed on
    the *sum* of the vector elements in each row of the table (i.e.  the
    reported  mean  value  is  that  of  all the individual sums in each
    row).  For alternate vector column handling, please use  the  ftstat
    task  which computes statistics for the total number of elements, in
    all of the rows of each column.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        The name of the FITS file (including extension number in  square
        brackets) of the input FITS table.
    
    colname [string]
        Name  of  the  column  in  the  input table.  The statistics are
        calculated   for   this    column.     If    the    column    is  
        multi-dimensional,  the  statistics  are based on the sum of all
        elements of the column.  The statistics on  a  specific  element
        of  the vector/array can be requested by specifying the element:
        COLNAME(10,4) or COLNAME[30;4].
    
    rows [string]
        String  containing  the  requested  rows  to  include   in   the 
        calculation.  If the value is "-", the entire file will be used.
    
    (outfile=STDOUT) [filename]
        Optional   output   file  name  to  write  the  statistics.   If 
        preceeded by a !, an existing file of  the  same  name  will  be
        overwritten.
    
    (maxval=INDEF) [real]
        The  maximum  value  to  include in the calculation.  A value of
        INDEF indicates  that  no  upper  limit  will  be  used  in  the
        calculation.
    
    (minval=INDEF) [real]
        The  minimum  value  to  include in the calculation.  A value of
        INDEF indicates no lower limit.
    
    (sum= ) [real]
        Value of the sum of the specified column  is  returned  to  this
        parameter.
    
    (mean= ) [real]
        Value  of  the  mean of the specified column is returned to this
        parameter.
    
    (sigma= ) [real]
        The  value  of  the  standard  deviation  is  written  to   this 
        parameter.
    
    (min= ) [real]
        The  minimum  value in the requested column is written into this
        parameter.
    
    (max= ) [real]
        The maximum value in the requested column  is  written  to  this
        parameter.
    
    (numb= ) [integer]
        The  number  of  values  actually  used  in  the  calculation is
        returned.
    
    (clobber=no) [boolean]
        If true, an existing file of the  same  name  as  the  requested
        output file will be overwritten.
    
    
EXAMPLES 
    1.   Compute  the  statistics  for  the  'FLUX' column in the second
        extension in the input FITS file named 'myfile.fits':
    
        ft> fstatistic myfile.fits[2] flux
