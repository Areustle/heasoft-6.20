DESCRIPTION
    
    This task reads a FITS file and verifies that the format conform  to
    the  specifications  of  the  FITS  Standard  (formally known as the
    NASA/Science Office of Standards and Technology "Definition  of  the
    Current  FITS Standard", document number, NOST 100-2.0, available on
    line  at   http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/).   The  following  error   or

           (**) only checked when "testdata" and "testfill" are 'Yes'
          (***) only checked when "testdata" and "tchksum" are 'Yes'
         (****) only checked when the "heasarc" is 'Yes'
    
    Every  HDU in the FITS file is checked in turn until the end of file
    is detected. A summary table is printed to  the  terminal   (or   to
    an  optional  output  file)  showing the structure of the FITS file.
    A  listing  of  all the header keywords may also be produced. At the
    end  of  the  verification, a summary of the  warnings and errors in
    each HDU are printed.
    
    The amount of information that is displayed can be  controlled  with
    the prhead, prstat and errreport parameters.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        Name  of  the FITS file to be verified. If this starts with  "@"
        then it  is assumed  to be an ascii file containing  a  list  of
        files (one filename per line) to be verified.
    
    (outfile = STDOUT) [file name]
        Name  of  output  verification report file.  If outfile is blank
        or  =  'STDOUT'  then  the  results  will  be  written   to  the 
        standard   output  device  (usually  the user's terminal) rather
        than to a file.  If preceded by a !, an  existing  file  of  the
        same name will be overwritten.
    
    (prhead = no) [boolean]
        Should  a  listing  of  the  header  keywords be included in the
        verification report?
    
    (prstat = yes) [boolean]
        Should a detailed verification report  be  produced?   If  'NO',
        then  only  a 1-line pass/fail message will be printed.  In this
        case, the OUTFILE and PRHEAD parameters are ignored.
    
    (errreport = "w") [string]
        The first letter of this parameter controls the level  of  error
        reporting, as follows:
           's' for "severe" - only report the most severe errors
           'e' for "errors" - report all errors
           'w' for "warnings" - report warnings as well as all errors
        Any other letter will be treated the same as the default 'w'.
    
    (testdata = yes) [boolean]
        Should  every  data  value  be  read and verified?  Turning this
        option off greatly increases the execution speed of the task  at
        the  expense  of  doing a less rigorous verification of the FITS
        file.
    
    (tchksum = yes) [boolean]
        Should the checksum of the  header  and  data  be  tested?   The
        tests  are  performed  only if the CHECKSUM and DATASUM keywords
        exist.
    
    (testfill = yes) [boolean]
        Should the bytes in the fill area be verified?  The  fill  areas
        are  defined  as  a)  gaps between ASCII table columns, b) bytes
        following the END card within the same FITS 2880-byte block  and
        c)  bytes  following  the  end  of the data within the same FITS
        2880-byte block.  The values of these fill bytes should have  no
        effect  on  the  data  in  the FITS file, nevertheless, the FITS
        standard requires that they have a zero, or in  some  cases,  an
        ASCII  blank value.  Invalid fill values may be an indication of
        more serious problems in the file.
    
    (heasarc = yes) [boolean] 
        Should  the  HEASARC  conventions  be  verified?   The   HEASARC 
        conventions  go  beyond  the offical NOST FITS Standard.  At the
        present time  the only significant HEASARC conventions are  that
        column  names  must begin with a letter and be unique within the
        first 16 characters.
    
    (numerrs = 0 ) [int] 
        Number of the errors found in the verification of the FITS file.
        For  multiple  input  files,  this  is the accumulated number of
        errors over all the files.
    
    (numwrns = 0 ) [int] 
        Number of the warnings found in the  verification  of  the  FITS
        file.   For multiple input files, this is the accumulated number
        of warnings over all the files.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        If true, a file of the same name as the  requested  output  file
        will be overwritten.
        
        
EXAMPLES
    1.  Verify the contents of the FITS file 'test.fits'.
    
            ft> fverify test.fits  
    
    2.   Verify  the  FITS  file  'test.fits'  and  print all the header
    keywords:
            ft> fverify test.fits prhead=yes 
    3.  Check the FITS   file  'test.fits'  for  only  the  most  severe
    errors,     ignoring less significant errors and warnings:
            ft> ftverify test.fits errreport=s
    4.   Verify a list of FITS files.  In this case 'filelist.txt' is an
    ASCII text file containing the list of files  to  be  verified,  one
    per  line.   Since  prstat=no, only a single line of output  will be
    written per file, stating whether the  file  passed  or  failed  the
    verification.
            ft> ftverify @filelist.txt prstat=no
    
    
BUGS
    
    If  there  are errors in a Data Unit, the fverify will quit the data
    test in the first occurrence of errors.  So the error "When  reading
    data..."  can  only be detected once.  It should not be assumed that
    there is only one error in data.
