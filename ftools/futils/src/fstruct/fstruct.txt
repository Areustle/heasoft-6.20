NAME
    fstruct -- Output the names, sizes, etc of extensions in input file
    
    
USAGE
    fstruct infile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task outputs to either the screen or  to  an  output  file  the
    name,  type,  and  size  of  the requested extension, as well as the
    values of  the  pcount  and  gcount  keywords.   Optionally,  select
    information  about  the  columns  contained  in the extension can be
    output.   The  information  can  be  requested  for  an   individual 
    extension,  or  for  the  whole input file.  The information is also
    written into hidden parameters in the parameter file.  If more  than
    one  extension's  information  is requested, the last the values for
    the last extension are saved.  Whether the file  is  a  FITS  format
    file  or  not  is  returned in the ISFITS parameter, and whether the
    requested extension exists or not is returned by the TYPE parameter.

    (type) [string]
        The  type  (PRIMARY/BINTABLE/TABLE/IMAGE)   of   the   requested

        exist.
    
    (naxis2) [integer]
