NAME
    fdelcol -- Delete a specified column in a FITS table
    
    
USAGE
    fdelcol infile[ext#] colname confirm proceed
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task deletes a column in a  FITS table.  Since the  input  FITS
    file  is  modified by this utility, the user is given an opportunity
    to confirm before deleting the column.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The file name and number or name of  the  extension   containing
        the  specified  column  to  be  deleted. The extension number or
        name has to be specified explicitly.
    
    colname [string]
        Name of the column to be deleted.
    
    (confirm = yes) [boolean]
        If set to YES, the following information (keyword values)  about
        the  extension  containing the specified column will be printed;
        EXTENSION, EXTNAME and Column Name.
    
    proceed = yes [boolean]
        At this point the user may  proceed or quit   without  modifying
        the  input  FITS file.  If the 'PROCEED' parameter is set to NO,
        then the program exits without modifying the input file.
        
        If 'CONFIRM' is set to NO and  'PROCEED'  is  set  to  YES,  the
        utility   simply   deletes  the  column  without  any  warnings. 
        (suitable for a script)
        
        
EXAMPLES
    1.  Delete the column COL1 in  the  second  extension  of  the  file
    test.fits,     without querying for confirmation.
    
            ft> fdelcol test.fits+2 COL1 N Y
    
    
    
BUGS
      For  the  safety,  the  user  has to specify the extension name or
    number   explicitly in input file name. If the user  does  not  give
    an  extension    number  or name, the program will generate an error
    message and   exit.

    delete columns from a FITS table.
