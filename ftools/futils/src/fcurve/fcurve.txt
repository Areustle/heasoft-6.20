NAME
    fcurve -- Bin column data into a light curve
    
    
USAGE
    fcurve  infile  gtifile  outfile  timecol   columns   binsz   lowval 
    highval
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  creates  a "light curve" or rates file by binning a list
    of events (typically a time ordered list of photon  events  detected
    with  a  particular  instrument)  into  a  specified  set of equally
    spaced time intervals.
    
    The binning has five modes: if 'binmode' = Sum, then the  output  is
    the  total  of  the  value of the counts; if 'binmode' = 'Rate' then
    the output is  the  total  of  the  value  of  the  counts/time;  if
    'binmode'  =  'Mean' then the output is the mean value of the binned
    quantity during each time interval; if 'binmode' =  'Event_sum'  the
    total  number  of  events  falling  in each bin are recorded; and if
    'binmode' = 'Event_rate' the  number  of  events/sec  is  collected.
    The  bin  size  and time ranges can be entered, or calculated by the
    program is the value is set equal to  INDEF.  If  the  bin  size  is
    INDEF, 100 equally spaced bins will be produced.
    
    An  optional  'Good Time Intervals"  FITS file may also be specified
    which defines the valid time intervals during which  the  instrument
    was  on  and able to detect events.  If a particular integration bin
    fall completely within a good time interval then  the  corresponding
    'Livetime'  column  will  be set equal to 1.0; otherwise, 'Livetime'
    will give the fraction of the time that the  instrument  was  in  an
    active  state  and  the  'binmode' and 'Error' columns in the output
    file will be adjusted accordingly.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        The name of the FITS file and extension number to be binned.
    
    gtifile = [filename]
        The  name  of  the  optional  FITS  GTI  file  to  be  used   in 
        normalization  of  bin  values.  If this parameter is blank, all
        of the times will be considered good.
    
    outfile [filename]
        The name of the output FITS file containing the bin values.   If
        preceed   by  a  !,  an  existing  file  of  the  same  name  is 
        overwritten.
    
    timecol [string]
        The  name  of  the  column  containing  the  time   (independent 
        variable).
    
    columns = [string]
        The  name  of the columns in the FITS file for the parameters to
        be binned.  For the "Events" values for  the  binmode  parameter
        this value is ignored.
    
    binsz = INDEF [double]
        The  size  of  bins to use in histogram.  If set equal to INDEF,
        100 bins will be produced.
    
    lowval = INDEF  [double]
        The lower limit for the histogram.  If set equal to  INDEF,  the
        lower limit will be calculated from the data.
    
    highval = INDEF [double]
        The  upper  limit  for the histogram. If set equal to INDEF, the
        upper limit will be calculated from the data.
    
    (binmode = "Rate") [string]
        The mode of binning the data.  Possible  modes  are  Sum,  Rate,
        Mean,  Event_sum  and  Event_rate.  Sum is a simple sum of event
        values. Rate is the sum divided by the active bin time. Mean  is
        the  mean  of  the  value of the events for that bin.  Event_sum
        counts the number of events falling in each bin  and  Event_rate
        is the number of events/second.
    
    (gticols = "START,STOP") [string]
        The  name  of the start and stop columns in the GTI FITS file to
        be used in normalization of bin values.
    
    (gtidate = MJDREF) [string]
        The  FITS  header  keyword  for  the  GTI  reference   date   of 
        observation.   This  parameter  may  be  in either julian day or
        dd/mm/yy or yyyy-mm-dd format, but must be the  same  format  as
        obsdate.  It is ignored is obsdate is blank or "-".
    
    (gtitime = ) [string]
        The   FITS   header  keyword  for  the  GTI  reference  time  of 
        observation.  This parameter is  only  used  if  obsdate  is  in
        dd/mm/yy or yyyy-mm-dd format.
    
    (extname = " ") [string]
        The  name of the FITS extname keyword to be placed in the output
        FITS file containing the light curve data.
    
    (obsdate = MJDREF) [string]
        The FITS header keyword for the reference date  of  observation.
        This  keyword  may  be  in  either julian days or in dd/mm/yy or
        yyyy-mm-dd format.  If blank (or "-"), reference  time  checking
        is ignored.
    
    (obstime = ) [string]
        The  FITS  header keyword for the reference time of observation.
        This parameter is  only  used  if  obsdate  is  in  dd/mm/yy  or
        yyyy-mm-dd format.
    
    (outtimecol = " ") [string]
        The  name of the FITS "time" column used to store the bin center
        values.  If blank or "-", the name of the input time  column  is
        used.
    
    (outcol = " ") [string]
        The  name  of  the FITS column(s) used to store the parameter(s)
        values.  If this value is blank or "-", the names of  the  input
        columns are used.
    
    (outerr = " ") [string]
        The  name  of  the  FITS  "error"  column(s)  used  to store the
        statistical error(s).   If  blank  or  "-",  the  names  of  the
        columns  will  be  the names of the input parameter columns with
        _Err appended.  If equal to "NONE", no  error  columns  will  be
        output.
    
    (outlive = "Livetime") [string]
        The  name  of the FITS "fractional integration time" column used
        to store the fractional integration time.  If blank or "-",  the
        livetime will not be output.
    
    (copyprime = yes) [boolean]
        If  true,  the  primary array will be copied to the output file.
        In addition, all keywords in the extension from which the  light
        curve was created from will be copied to the new extension.
    
    (copyall = no) [boolean]
        If  true,  all other extensions in the input file will be copied
        to the output file.  The value of copyprime is ignored  if  this
        flag is set.
    
    (sensecase = yes) [boolean]
        Whether to make the input to FCURVE case sensitive or not.
    
    (clobber = yes) [boolean]
        If  true,  an existing file with the same name as that specified
        for the output file name will be overwritten.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.  Bin the data in the PHA and TIME columns of the first  extension
    of  the  FITS file data.fits into 100 second bins starting from time
    5 to time 3600 and write  lcrv.fits using  the  first  extension  of
    gti.fits as the gti file.
    
         ft> fcurve data.fits gti.fits lcrv.fits TIME PHA 100 5 3600
    
    2.  As above, but you don't know much of anything about values of
    the data in the input file, and do not have a gti file.
    
         ft> fcurve data.fits " " lcrv.fits TIME PHA INDEF INDEF INDEF
    
    
BUGS
    The  sensecase  parameter only affects the time (independent) column
    name.
    
    
NOTES
    Previously, this task included a parameter to offset the time  value
    by  the  amount  of  the  first  time  in  the  light  curve.   This 
    functionality has been moved into FPLOT.
