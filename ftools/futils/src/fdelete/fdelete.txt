NAME
    fdelete -- Delete a FITS file.
    
    
USAGE
    fdelete file confirm
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Delete  a  FITS  file, with or without user confirmation.  This task
    is mainly useful for deleting FITS  files  that  have  been  written
    into  shared  memory  because the system command to delete a file in
    shared memory is a bit convoluted.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    file [filename]
        The name of the FITS file to be deleted.
    
    (confirm = yes) [boolean]
        If confirm=yes, the task will prompt the user  to  confirm  that
        he/she  really  wants  to  delete  the file.  If confirm=no, the
        file will be deleted without user confirmation.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1. Delete the  file  OBSERV.FITS,  first  providing  a  confirmation
    prompt.
    
        fi> fdelete OBSERV.FITS
    
    2. Unconditionally delete the file OBJECT3.FITS.
    
        fi> fdelete OBSERV.FITS confirm=no
