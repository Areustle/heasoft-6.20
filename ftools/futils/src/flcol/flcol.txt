NAME
    flcol -- List FITS table column information.
    
    
USAGE
    flcol filename[ext#]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task lists information about the columns in an ASCII or binary
    table extension in a FITS file.  By default the  output  is  written
    to  the  terminal  (STDOUT), but the 'outfile' parameter may be used
    to direct the output to an ASCII file instead.  There is one line of
    output  for  each  column  in  the  table,  and each output line may
    contain the column name, FITS data type, and units of the column.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        A file name (and extension number in square brackets) for  which
        column  information  is  to  be listed.  If an asterisk is input
        for the extension number, then all table extensions in the  FITS
        file will be listed (e.g., 'FILENAME.FITS[*]')
    
    (nlist = 3) [integer, min=1, max=3]
        The  number  of  items  to  list.   The  output  will consist of
        'nlist' columns, one line for each column  that  is  defined  in
        the  table.  The items listed out are column name (displayed for
        all 'nlist' values), data type (displayed if  'nlist'  is  2  or
        higher),  and units (if 'nlist' is 3).  If 'nlist = 1', only the
        column name will be displayed; the output  list  may  be  edited
        and  used  as  input  to  other  tasks such as  'ftabcopy'.  Set
        'nlist' to 3 to generate a list  that  can   be   used   as   an
        input column-description file for the 'fcreate' task.
    
    (outfile = STDOUT) [file name]
        An  optional name of the output ASCII file into which the column
        information will be written.  The default  of  'STDOUT'  directs
        output  to the terminal.  If preceeded by !, an existing file of
        the same name will be overwritten.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        If true, an existing file of the  same  name  as  the  requested
        output filename will be overwritten.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   Display  the names, data types, and units of all the columns in
    all the table extensions in the FITS file 'test.fits':
    
            ft> flcol test.fits[*]
    
    2.  Display the column names in the first extension of the test.fits
    FITS file and write the output to an ASCII file called test.out:
    
            ft> flcol test.fits nlist=1 outfile=test.out
