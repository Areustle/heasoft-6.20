    cphead --  Copy keywords from one FITS header  to  another  existing
    FITS file header.
    
    
USAGE
    cphead infile outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  copies keywords from one FITS header to another existing
    FITS file header.  If a keyword already exists in  the  second  FITS
    file,  its  value  and  comment will be updated with the values from
    first FITS file.
    
    The  following  basic  FITS  keywords  are  normally   not   copied: 
    "SIMPLE",   "BITPIX",   "NAXIS",   "EXTEND",  "XTENSION",  "PCOUNT", 
    "GCOUNT", "TFIELDS", "TTYPE", "TBCOL",  "TFORM",  "TUNIT",  "THEAP",
    "TDIM", "GROUPS", "DATASUM", "CHECKSUM", and "END".
    
    The  scale  related  keywords  ("TSCAL",  "TZERO", "TNULL", "TDISP",
    "BSCALE", "BZERO",  "BUNIT",  "BLANK",  "CTYPE",  "CRPIX",  "CROTA",
    "CRVAL",  "CDELT",  "TLMIN",  "TLMAX",  "OPTIC",  "TCRPX",  "TCRVL", 
    "TCDLT", "TCTYP", "TCD", "TCROT"and "PLTSCL")  are  only  copied  or
    updated if SCALE = YES.
    
    An  optional  list  of  other  keywords that should or should not be
    copied can be supplied with the KEYFIL parameter.

    infile [string]
        File name and extension of the input FITS header.

    (keyfil = "") [string]
        Optional text file containing a list of keywords, one per  line,

        (!).   The  other  listed keywords will be copied, regardless of
        whether they are one of  the  basic  or  scale  keywords  listed
        above.
