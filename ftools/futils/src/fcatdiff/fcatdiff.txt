NAME
    fcatdiff  - This task compares specified columns of a fits file, and
    reports those that differ from row to row.
    
    
USAGE
    fcatdiff infile outfile keywords
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The task takes the columns listed in the parameter keywords  in  the
    file  outfile,  and writes a new row into the file outfile each time
    the value in one of these  columns  changes  between  two  adjoining
    rows.   It  writes  out the column name and type, and the old value,
    and the new  value.   The  latter  two  are  written  out  as  ascii
    strings.   If  none  of the keyword column values have changed, then
    it writes 'NONE' in the parameter column,  and  'NA'  in  the  value
    columns.   It  will also copy over other of the columns in the input
    file, if they are listed in the parameter copyover.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        The file name and extension number in  square  brackets  of  the
        input table.
    
    outfile [filename]
        The  name  of  the  output FITS table.  If preceeded by a !, and
        existing file of the same name will be overwritten.
    
    keywords [string]
        A list of the columns in the input file  whose  differences  are
        to  be reported.  A '-' means to use all the keywords not listed
        in the copyover and  exclude  parameter  lists.   If  the  first
        character  of the string is '@', the rest of the string is taken
        to be a filename containing the column names, one per line.
    
    (copyover = " ") [string]
        A list  of  the  columns  to  be  copied  over  from  infile  to
        outfile.  The '@' sign has the same meaning as for keywords.
    
    (exclude = " ") [string]
        A  list of columns to be excluded from the keywords list if that
        has the value '-'.  The '@' sign has the  same  meaning  as  for
        keywords.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        If  true, a file with the same name as the requested output file
        will be overwritten.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   Record the differences in the columns BIT_RATE and MODE in the 
         file cat.fits, copying over the columns TSTART and TSTOP. 
    
          ft> fcatdiff cat.fits out.fits "BIT_RATE MODE" copyover = "TSTART TSTOP"
