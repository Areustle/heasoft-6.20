NAME
    ftabkey --  Copy a FITS table element to a FITS header keyword.
    
    
USAGE
    ftabkey tblfile[ext#] column row fitsfile[ext#] keyword
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  copies   the  value  of  an  element  in  a  FITS  table
    extension  (either  an  ASCII  or a binary table)  to the value of a
    keyword in the header of the same or  a  different  FITS  file.   An
    error  message  is  printed  if  the table element is undefined.  By
    default, only values of existing keywords may be  modified,  but  if
    the  hidden parameter 'add' is set to "yes", then this task will add
    a new keyword to the header if it doesn't already exist.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    tblfile [file name]
        The name, including extension and  extension  number  in  square
        brackets  (e.g.,  myfile.fits[3])  of the input FITS table to be
        read.  By default the first extension will be read.
    
    column [string] 
        Column name in table to be read.  (Name is not case sensitive).
    
    row [integer]
        Row number in table to be read.
    
    fitsfile [file name]
        The name, including extension and  extension  number  in  square
        brackets,  of  the  FITS header to be modified.  If this name is
        blank then the keyword will be written  to  the  header  of  the
        table that was read.
    
    keyword [string]
        Name  of  header keyword to be modified (or added if it does not
        exist and if the 'add' parameter =  'yes').   The  name  is  not
        case sensitive.
    
    (element = 1) [string]
        If  the  column  contains  an  array  of  values (i.e., a vector
        column in a binary  table)  then  this  is  the  number  of  the
        element  within  the  vector to be read.  If the column contains
        an array, specify all dimensions: 23,2.
    
    (add = no) [boolean]
        Is it OK to create a new keyword if it does not currently exist?
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.  Copy  the value in the 10th row of the  'WAVELENGTH'  column  in
    the  FITS  file  myfile.fits[4]  to  a keyword called WAVEVAL in the
    primary header in the file datfile.fits:
    
         ft> ftabkey myfile.fits[4] wavelength 10 datfile.fits[0] waveval
