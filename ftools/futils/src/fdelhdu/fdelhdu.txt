NAME
    fdelhdu -- Delete an extension from a FITS file
    
    
USAGE
    fdelhdu infile[ext#] confirm proceed
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  deletes  an extension (not the primary) of a  FITS file.
    Since  the  input  FITS  file  is  modified  by  this  utility,   an 
    opportunity is given to confirm before deleting the extension.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The  file  name  and  number  or  name  of  the  extension to be
        deleted.  The extension number  or  name  has  to  be  specified
        explicitly.
    
    (confirm = yes) [boolean]
        If  set to YES, the following information (keyword values) about
        the selected extension  will  be  printed;  EXTENSION,  EXTNAME,
        NAXIS, NAXES[].
    
    proceed = yes [boolean]
        At  this  point the user may  proceed or quit  without modifying
        the input FITS file.  If the 'PROCEED' parameter is set  to  NO,
        then  the  program  exits  without modifying the input file.  If
        'CONFIRM' is set to NO and 'PROCEED' is set to YES, the  utility
        simply  deletes  the  extension  without any warnings. (suitable
        for a script)
        
        
EXAMPLES
    1.  Delete the second extension from the input file test.fits.
    
            ft> fdelhdu test.fits+2 N Y
    
    
    
BUGS
    The user has to provide the extension number or name of  input  file
    explicitly.   Otherwise  the  program  will give a error message and
    quit.

    to delete extensions from a FITS file.
