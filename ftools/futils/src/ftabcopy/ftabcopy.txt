NAME
    ftabcopy  --  Copy specified columns and rows from a FITS table to a
    new FITS table.
    
    
USAGE
    ftabcopy infile[ext#] outfile columns rows
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task will create a new FITS file (with a binary or ASCII  table
    extension)  containing  a  subset  of  the  columns  and  rows in an
    existing FITS table extension.  The desired column names  are  given
    as  a  column  name  template.   Row  ranges could also be given and
    there could be as much as 15 ranges at present.  By  default  it  is
    '-'  which  is  all  rows  of  the  input file.  Also, it copies the
    following WCS related keywords: TLMIN, TLMAX, TCTYP,  TCRCL,  TCDLT,
    TCRPX, TCROT, and TCRVL.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        Name of the FITS table extension (including  optional  extension
        number in square brackets) from which  the  columns  are  to  be
        copied.
    
    outfile [filename]
        Name  of  the  new  FITS file to contain the copied columns.  By
        default, the output file will consist of a  null  primary  array
        followed  by  an  ASCII  or binary table extension, depending on
        the type  of  input  file  extension.   If  preceded  by  !,  an
        existing file of the same name is overwritten.
    
    columns [string]
        List  of  column  names in the order to be copied from the input
        FITS  table  into  the  new  FITS  file.   The  names  are  case 
        sensitive.   The  column  names should be separated by commas or
        white space.  Instead of directly listing all the column  names,
        one  may  specify the name of an ASCII file (preceded by the "@"
        character) containing all of the column names to be copied,  one
        name  per  line  in  the  file.   The  flcol task may be used to
        generate a column name template which may  then  be  edited  for
        input  to  this  task.   If the first non-white character in the
        column template is the negation  character  (-),  the  new  FITS
        file  will  contain  all  the columns in the input file that are
        NOT listed in the column template.
    
    rows [string]
        List of row ranges separated by comma  (,)  to  be  copied  from
        input  file.   At  most 15 ranges can be accomodated at present.
        By default all rows are copied.
    
    (outtype = SAME) [string]
        Specify the type of output extension  -  ASCII  or  BINARY.   If
        outtype  is  SAME, the output extension type will be the same as
        the input extension type.
    
    (inull = -999) [integer]
        Value to use for  NULL  in  integer  columns  for  ASCII->BINARY
        translation.   Used  only  if  the  defined  NULL  is illegal or
        undefined.
    
    (snull = "UNDEF") [string]
        Value to use for NULL in column  in  BINARY->ASCII  translation.
        Used only if the defined NULL is illegal or undefined.
    
    (unique = no) [boolean]
        Eliminate  duplicate rows from the output FITS file? If 'unique'
        is set to "yes", only one of  each  set  of  duplicate  rows  is
        included  in  the  output FITS table.  All columns in the output
        FITS table must be identical for the row to be removed.   String
        comparisons are case sensitive.
    
    (copyprime = yes) [boolean]
        If  true, the primary header and array of the input file will be
        copied to the output file.
    
    (copyall = no) [boolean]
        Copy all other extensions (and the  primary  array)  from  input
        FITS  file  to  the  output  FITS  file?   If true, the value of
        copyprime is ignored.
    
    (copykeys = yes) [boolean]
        Copy all the additional non-required  keywords  from  the  input
        FITS  table  header to the output table header?   If false, then
        only the essential keywords needed to define the  structure  and
        WCS of the table columns will be copied.
    
    (history=yes) [boolean]
        When  this parameter is true, FTABCOPY will add a history record
        to indicate that it acted on the file.
    
    (clobber=no) [boolean]
        If true, an existing file with the same name  as  the  requested
        output file is overwritten.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1. Copy the name, mag, and color columns from the starcat.fits file:
    
         ft> ftabcopy starcat.fits starmag.fits name,mag,color
    
    2. Copy all the columns except the 'error' column:
    
         ft> ftabcopy meas.fits nomeas.fits -error
    
    3. Copy the rows 1-10, 35, 105 etc:
    
         ft> ftabcopy rows=1-10, 35, 105
    
    
    
NOTES:
    In  the  BINARY->ASCII  translation, complex and logical data types,
    variable length arrays and vector columns are  not  supported.   Bit
    and Byte columns are mapped to integer.
    
    
BUGS
    NULLs in ASCII columns are not retained in either translation.
    
    
SEE ALSO
    ftcopy,  ftlist,  ftselect,  ftverify. fv, the interactive FITS file
    editor, can also be used to copy columns to a new table.
