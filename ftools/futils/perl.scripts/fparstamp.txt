NAME
    fparstamp - Copy the entire contents of a FTOOLS .par 
                file into a FITS file as a HISTORY block.
    
USAGE
    fparstamp -t taskname -o filename[ext#]
or  
    fparstamp
    
DESCRIPTION
    This script is designed to be used immediately after running
    any FTOOL which writes or modifies a FITS file. The user must
    specify the name of an FTOOL (presumably the one which wrote or
    modified the FITS file) and the name of the output FITS file.
    FPARSTAMP will copy the current state of the FTOOL's parameter
    file into a HISTORY block in the specified FITS file (appended
    to the first extension unless another extension number is given).

PARAMETERS (SWITCHES/FLAGS)
    -h                       - print this help file

    -o {FITS filename[ext#]} - the FITS file (and optional extension #)
                               into which to copy the .par file contents

    -t {FTOOLS taskname}     - the FTOOL whose .par file should be copied
    
EXAMPLES
    1. fparstamp -t fcollect -o myfile+0

     Append the contents of the parameter file from fcollect 
     onto the primary array header of "myfile".

    2. fparstamp

     Prompt for the name of a valid FTOOLS task and FITS filename,
     then write a HISTORY block listing the .par file contents
     into the FITS file.

NOTES
    This script will NOT work on Perl scripts, only on compiled FTOOLS
    tasks (because only the latter have associated .par files!)
