                 ****** fapropos ******

Searches Ftools help files for a given word (or words).

SWITCHES:
    -b  Searches only the brief description of each help file
    -e  Print out the expression fapropos is using
    -h  Gives this help
    -l  List the matches, without the short description
    -p  The arguments will be concatenated and passed straight to
         the regular expression search.  This will facilitate entering
         more complicated regular expressions.
    -s  Makes the search case sensitive
    -w  Makes matches for whole words only

USAGE:

fapropos [-s] arg1 arg2 ...

	The arguments are taken as a list of regular expressions, and
OR'ed before being applied to the text of the help files.  The only 
restriction is that each expression cannot contain spaces.

EXAMPLE:

fapropos arf rmf

Looks for tasks whose help files mention arf or rmf.
