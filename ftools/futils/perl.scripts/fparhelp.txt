                 ****** fparhelp ******

Lists the help file for the specified parameter for the given ftool.
fparhelp attempts to determine help on an individual parameter by 
parsing the IRAF help file for that ftool, this might fail, so in a 
script, you should probably choose an appropriate '-e' option.

USAGE:

fparhelp ftool parname


FLAGS:

Flags must be given before the positional arguments (i.e. the name of 
the ftool and the parameter).

-h          print this help

-e  -1|0|1  what to do if fparhelp can not determine parameter specific
            help:

              -1  print the whole help file for ftool (default)

	       0  happily do nothing
             
               1  exit with an error status and an error message

            Note: fparhelp *always* reports an error if it can''t even 
            *find* the required helpfiles.

CAVEAT:

This program was designed to be called by other programs.  While it will
probably work by itself, its behavior might not always be intuitive.
