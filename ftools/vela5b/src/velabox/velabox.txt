NAME
    velabox - FTOOL to select raw data files needed for FVELALC
    
    
USAGE
    velabox long_src lat_src searchrad
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
    This FTOOL generates a list of Vela 5B raw data files which  contain
    data within a specified radius  of  a  position  in  the  sky.   The
    listed  files  should  be  FTPed  from the HEASARC's Legacy computer
    (legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov; /vela5b/data/raw/) to the  current  directory
    before running FVELALC.
    
    For    further    information    regarding    this   task,   current  
    plans/schedule, comments or bug reports,  please  contact  Jesse  S.
    Allen (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/ftoolshelp).
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    long_src [real]
        The galactic longitude (LII) of the source.
    
    lat_src [real]
        The galactic latitude (BII) of the source.
    
    searchrad [real]
        The  search  radius  around  the  source  position from which to
        include data.  The recommended search  radius  is  5.0  degrees.
        At   5.0  degrees  from  the  source,  the  collimator  response 
        function becomes so small that very little  extra  data  can  be
        collected   at   a   greater  radius,  and  collimator  response 
        corrections will greatly magnify  the  variance  of  this  data.
        Larger  radii also increase the likiehood of including data from
        a nearby source.
