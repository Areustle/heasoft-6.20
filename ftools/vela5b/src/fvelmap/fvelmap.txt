DESCRIPTION
    
    This FTOOL generates a FITS map light curve from  the  Vela  5B  raw
    data.   The map is rectangular in cartesian galactic coordinates and
    is only intended for FVELGALLC FTOOL.  The map  should  include  all
    sources  of  potential  confusion within the field of the two object
    of interest.

PARAMETERS
    
    long_cnr1 [real]
        The galactic longitude (LII) of one corner  of  the  rectangular
        region  to  be  mapped.   If the map region crosses longitude 0,
        either corner1_long or corner2_long should be > 360.
    
    lat_cnr1 [real]
        The galactic latitude (BII) of one  corner  of  the  rectangular
        region  to  be mapped.  Latitude is restricted to lie within the
        galactic plane (-48 <= latitude <= 48)
    
    lat_cnr2 [real]
        The galactic longitude (LII)  of  the  opposite  corner  of  the
        rectangular  region  to  be  mapped.   If the map region crosses
        longitude 0, either corner1_long or  corner2_long  should  be  >
        360.
    
    lat_cnr2 [real]
        The  galactic  latitude  (BII)  of  the  opposite  corner of the
        rectangular region to be mapped.  Latitude is restricted to  lie
        within the galactic plane (-48 <= latitude <= 48)
    
    backopt [integer]
        Which   model  of  the  Vela  5B  background  rates  to  use  in 
        correcting the data.  There are two options:
        
            1  Use the original linear background model
        
            2  Use the sinusoidal modeled background
    
    minflux [real]
        The minimum flux level to include in the data.   NULL  data  for
        the  Vela  5B  mission has been recorded as -100.0: we recommend
        setting the minimum acceptable value to -100.0  in  include  all
        data (NULL data will not be included).
    
    maxflux [real]
        The maximum flux level to include in the data.
    
    maxerr [real]
        The maximum background level to accept in the data.
    
    spincheck [boolean]
        Whether  or  not  to  reject data points which have been flagged
        for irregularities in the spin period of the Vela 5B satellite.
    
    pointcheck [boolean]
        Whether or not to reject data points  which  have  been  flagged
        for errors in the pointing of the Vela 5B satellite.
    
    beginyr [integer]
        The  calendar  year  in which to start collecting data.  Vela 5B
        was launched in  1969  and  stopped  operating  in  1979;  years
        outside  this  range  will  not  be accepted.  You may entry the
        year in full (e.g. 1969) or just the last  two  trailing  digits
        (e.g. 69).
    
    beginday [integer]
        The  day  of  the  start  year in which to begin accepting data.
        The entry should be the number of days  since  January  0  (e.g.
        day 32 = 1 February). Data from that day will be included.
    
    endyr [integer]
        The  calendar  year in which to stop including data in the light
        curve.  The maximum acceptable value is 80  (or  1980;  entering
        day  1 of 1980 for a stop date ensures that data is included all
        the way to the end of the Vela 5B mission).
    
    endday [integer]
        The day of the stop year in which to cease accepting  data.  The
        entry  should be the number of days since January 0 (e.g. day 32
        = 1 February).  Data from that day will be included.
    
    timbin [integer]
        The size of the bins in seconds.  The recommended  bin  size  is
        of  the  order  of  several  days  if  light  curves  are  to be
        generated for a significant  fraction  of  the  entire  Vela  5B
        mission.
    
    weight [boolean]
        Whether  or  not  to weight the data according to the background
        levels when binning the data.
    
    
    
BUGS
    Small time bins may exceed memory capacity, especially  on  machines
    with  smaller  memories.   However, there are no useful applications
    known at this time for which  high  time  resolution  maps  spanning
    large portions of the 10 year Vela 5B mission would be required.
    
    If  the  map  region crosses LII = 360, longitude of one corner must
    be > 360.  For example, a map spanning from 355 to 5 would  need  to
    be  entered  as  355 to 365.  This is the standard logic used in the
    original Vela 5B programs on which this FTOOL is based.
    
    
    
LOG OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
    
    v1.3 (1996 Mar)
           Disabled the no background  option.   Use  of  no  background
        results  in  large  spikes  in  the  data  and background during
        geotail transits by the satellite.   These  can  be  fitted  and
        removed  by the background removal withing the FVELMAP task: the
        background fitting of individual sources in the  FVELGALLC  task
        is  unable  to  do  so.      Latitude  inputs  restricted to the
        galactic plane.
    
    v1.2 (1996 Jan)
           Forced  a  minimum  array  size  to  prevent  dynamic  memory 
        allocation  error.   Corrected logic used to remove NULL entries
        so all empty maps are removed,  not  all  but  the  last  as  in
        previous   versions.    Simplified   logic   for   storing   map  
        coordinates.
    
    v1.1 (1995 Sep)
           Longitude inputs accept LII  >  360  to  allow  for  galactic
        center maps.
    
    v1.0 (1995 Aug)
           First release version
    
    v0.9 (1995 Feb)
           Beta test version
