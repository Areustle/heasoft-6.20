You now have the option to restrict the subsequent analysis to
only those photons that were detected within certain time intervals.
If you prefer to accept all
the photons in the observation, simply
click on the 'Exit' button in the 'Edit X Range' control window to 
continue on to 
the next step in the analysis.  Otherwise use the mouse to select the
time time range(s) of interest on the plotted light curve,
then click on the 'Save' button.
