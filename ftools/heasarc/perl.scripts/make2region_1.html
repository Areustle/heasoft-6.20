<p>
<center><h4>Select the Source Region...</h4></center>
<p>
Use the mouse to draw a region around the source 
of interest; all the photons within this region will be integrated to
form the source spectrum.
A default circular region is usually shown on the image, centered on
the catalogued RA and Dec position of the source, but you may want to adjust the 
diameter and/or center of the circle using the mouse.  Click the 'Save...'
button on the 'Edit Region' window when you are finished.
<p>
In order to accurately position the regions it
may be helpful to use the right mouse button to zoom in on the source
and/or to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image   Use the 
control panel on the 'Edit Region' window to set which of these functions 
you want the right mouse button to control.
<p>
More complicated source regions may be selected by using multiple 
region shapes and/or by using rectangular, elliptical, or
polygon-shaped regions.  You can also exclude areas within other regions, 
for example, to define an annular region.  The excluded
regions are drawn in red (by default) and are preceded by a minus sign
in the output ASCII region file.
More complete instructions on defining regions are available in the 
<a href =Regions.html>region</a> help file.
