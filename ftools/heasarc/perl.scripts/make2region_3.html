Now define a 2nd region file that encloses a representative area
of background emission in the image.  This will be subtracted from the 
source spectrum during the spectral fitting process.  
If you do not want to subtract any background emission from the
source spectrum, simply click the 'Exit' button on the 'Edit Region' window.
<p>

Choose as large a background
region as is practical while still excluding other contaminating
sources. The intensity of the background spectrum will be normalized to 
correspond to the area of the source region.
<p>
The background is typically defined by a number of small
regions (circles, ellipses or boxes),
avoiding any obvious emission sources.  The emission
within all these regions will be added together to form the  
background spectrum.
<p>  
An alternate method is to draw a single large background region and
then exclude smaller regions within it around any contaminating sources 
(like swiss cheese).  In this case you may need to temporarily move the large 
'included' region to one side in order to draw the excluded regions.
