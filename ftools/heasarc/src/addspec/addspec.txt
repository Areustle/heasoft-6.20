NAME
    addspec -- adds PHA spectra, bkgd files & combines response matrices
    
    
USAGE
    addspec infil outfil qaddrmf qsubback
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
      This task is essentially a FORTRAN wrapper for the tasks  mathpha,
    marfrmf  and addrmf. The input is an ASCII file containing a list of
    PHA datasets to be added together. The task performs this  operation
    via  a call to mathpha, with several parameters able to be specified
    by the user. In addition, should the user  so-wish,  any  background
    PHA  datasets  and/or  detector  redistribution & ancillary response
    datasets specified via keywords in the input PHA  datasets  will  be
    combined  appropriately (see below). Thus the final output from this
    task is the summed PHA  file,  plus  (if  possible)  an  appropriate
    background  PHA  file and/or response matrix. Keywords in the output
    file are updated to specify the background PHA file and/or  response
    matrix,  enabling  them to be automatically read into XSPEC when the
    output PHA is read in.
    
      Users are WARNED that the addition of different PHA datasets is  a
    dangerous  exercise,  and  give rise to very misleading results from
    subsequent analysis.  The two occasions where the  addition  of  PHA
    datasets *may* be valid is
    A) to combine PHAs from different observations made by the same
    detector of a given source,
    B) to combine PHAs made at the same time by different but
    "identical" detectors.
    In  case  A),  incorrect  or  misleading results will most likely be
    produced if the source  exhibits  variability  (especially  spectral
    variability),  and  could  easily be produced if the response of the
    detector  changes   dramatically   between   the   epochs   of   the 
    observation.  In  case  B), incorrect or misleading results could be
    produced if the detectors are not actually  "identical",  and  their
    reponses  differ  significantly. In both cases, errors could also be
    introduced  by   the   datasets   having   significantly   different 
    backgrounds   (rates  or  spectra).  Users  are  STRONGLY  urged  to 
    consider these facts before using the task.
    
      Only the the OGIP-recognised PHA file formats described in  Arnaud
    etal  1992  (Legacy,  2,  65) and its appendix provided in OGIP memo
    OGIP/92-007a are  supported  for  both  the  input  and  output  PHA
    datasets,  and  only  the  OGIP-recognised  RMF  &  ARF file formats
    described in George etal 1992  (Legacy,  2,  51)  and  its  appendix
    provided  in OGIP Calibration memo CAL/GEN/92-002a are supported for
    both the input and output RMF, ARF & RMF datasets.
    
    
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infil [character string]
         The name of an ASCII file listing the input  PHA  files  to  be
        added.  This  ASCII  file should be in a format whereby there is
        one file per line, and should include the path to each  file  if
        it is not in the current working directory.
    
    outfil [character string]
         A  character  string giving the root of the names of the output
        files to be created. The task will append a ".pha" to this  root
        in  order  to construct the name of the summed PHA file created,
        and (if applicable) ".bak" and/or ".rsp" for the  names  of  the
        background PHA dataset and/or detector response matrice.
    
    (qaddpha=yes) [boolean]
         This  parameter  is a place-holder, and currently should always
        be set to true.
    
    (units=C) [character string]
         This parameter is for  the  spawns  to  mathpha.  Generally  it
        should  be  left  with  its  default  value unless you have been
        instructed otherwise by GOF personel, or really understand  what
        you  are  doing.  Essentially,  it  gives  the physical units in
        which the algebraic expression  is  to  be  evaluated  (and  the
        units  in which the output file will be written). A value of 'C'
        (ie 'COUNTS' - the default), or 'R' (ie 'RATE')  result  in  the
        algebra  bing  performed  in  'COUNTS'  and  'COUNTS PER SECOND'
        space respectively. The algebra will be performed in this  space
        irrespective  of  whether the input files contain data stored in
        counts or in counts per second (ie, if units='C', then input PHA
        histograms  stored in counts/s will be converted to counts prior
        to any mathematical operations being  performed).  There  are  a
        number  of  alternative  values  for  this  parameter  (see  the 
        mathpha Users' Gude), but  these  are  reserved  for  expert-use
        only.
    
    qaddrmf [boolean]
         A  flag  indicating  whether the task should try to construct a
        detector  response  matrix  appropriate  for  the   output   PHA 
        dataset.  This  can  only be performed if the input PHA datasets
        contain the necessary keywords (RESPFILE,  ANCRFILE)  specifying
        the paths and names of the relevant RMF, ARF or RSP files.
    
    qsubback [boolean]
         A  flag  indicating  whether the task should try to construct a
        background PHA dataset appropriate for use with the  output  PHA
        dataset.  This  can  only be performed if the input PHA datasets
        contain the necessary keyword  (BACKFILE)  specifying  the  path
        and name of the relevant background file for each.
    
    (bexpscale = 1000) [real]
         A  scaling  factor to be used to avoid "rounding errors" in the
        background PHA dataset.  This  factor  is  only  important  when
        qsubback=yes,  units=C,  and the background datasets contain low
        count rates. In such cases, then this parameter is  a  numerical
        factor  by  which the background counts (and statistical errors)
        are multiplied by, prior to rescaling  and  addition  to  create
        the  output  background  PHA  dataset.  The exposure time in the
        output background PHA dataset is also multiplied by  this  value
        in  order  to  "correct"  for  this procedure. It is recommended
        that this  parameter  has  a  value  of  at  least  the  default
        (bexpscale = 1000).
    
    (properr='no') [character string]
         A  flag  whether  the  errors  are  to  propagated  during  the 
        algebra, or (if properr='no')  whether  the  errors  are  simply
        calculated from the resultant PHA dataset.
    
    (errmeth='POISS-0') [character string]
         A  flag  indicating what error presciption is to be used should
        errors need  to  calculated  by  the  task  at  any  stage.  The
        following values are currently allowed:
        
        ERRMETH = 'Gauss'
            whereby the errors are calculated using SQRT(N).
        
        ERRMETH = 'POISS-0'
            (the  default)  whereby errors are not explicitly calculated
            and the POISSERR flag is set to T in the resulting spectrum.
        
        ERRMETH = 'POISS-1'
            whereby the algorithm of Gehrels (1986 ApJ, 303, 336) eqn  7
            (+ve error) is used.
        
        ERRMETH = 'POISS-2'
            whereby  the  algorithm  of Gehrels (1986 ApJ, 303, 336) eqn
            11 (-ve error) is used.
        
        ERRMETH = 'POISS-3'
            whereby 0.5  * (POISS-1 + POISS-2) is used
        Caution is urged, particularly when using ERRMETH = 'Gauss',  as
        unexpected  and/or  misleading  results  can  be  produced.  See 
        OGIP/95-008 for further details.
    
    (chatter = 9) [integer]
         Flag to indicate how chatty the task is at execution.  A  value
        of  9  is  the   default,  with  lower/higher  values  producing 
        quieter/verbose output  respectively.
    
    (schatter = 5) [integer]
        Integer flag to indicate how chatty the spawned  tasks  will  be
        during  their  execution.  A  value  of  5  is the default, with
        lower/higher    values    producing    quieter/verbose    output   
        respectively.
    
    (clobber = false) [boolean]
         Flag  specifying  whether  or  not a pre-existing file with the
        same name as that  requested as the output file from  this  task
        will  be  overwritten. This  parameter is required to be present
        by the  FTOOLS  group  and  NASA/GSFC  and   provides  the  same
        functionality   as  that  described  above  whereby  the  output 
         filename can be preceeded by "!" at the outfil.  It  should  be
        noted  that   "!filename"  syntax  will  overwrite  any existing
        files irrespective of the  value of the clobber parameter.
