NAME
    chkrmf  --  Checks  the  validity  of  the  mandatory  and  optional 
    keywords of an RMF FITS file before input to XSPEC.
    
    
USAGE
    chkrmf infile=filename1 outfile=filename2 [chatter=11]
    or,
    chkrmf filename1 outfile=filename2
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The task performs the necessary checks, e.g, validity  of  mandatory
    and  optional  keywords, on an input FITS file of response matrix to
    determine whether it is in the correct format to  be  acceptable  as
    an  input to XSPEC (and hence several other ftools tasks), reporting
    back to STDOUT (and/or an ASCII file) the results.   To  get  report
    to  STDOUT,  user needs to use chatter >=10 .  This task handles RMF
    & EBOUNDS extension.  Both the extensions need to be present  for  a
    valid  response  matrix  file.  The task checks if both the MATRIX &
    EBOUNDS extensions are present, then goes for checking for keywords.
    If  either  of  the  extensions  are absent then it exits with error
    reminding user that both extensions need be present.
    
    The mandatory keyword checked are:
    
    EXTNAME, TELESCOP, INSTRUME, FILTER, RMFVERSN, DETCHANS & TLMIN4
    
    Note: TLMIN4 is checked for extension SPECRESP  only,  and  not  for
    EBOUNDS.   Also,  if  TLMAX4  present,  checks  are  performed  that 
    detchan = tlmax4-tlmin4+1
    
    The optional keyword checked are:
    
    PHAFILE, HDUCLASS, HDUCLAS1, HDUCLAS2, HDUCLAS3 & HDUVERS1
    
    NOTE: Optional  keywords  are  suggested,  as  they  supply  further
    detailed informations regarding data sets.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [character string]
        The input file name containing response matrix data.
    
    (outfile = rmf.log) [character string]
        The  name  of  the  output  log  file  name.   Default is set to
        'rmf.log'.  If user wants to use other output  file  name,  then
        one has to type outfile=filename in the command line.
    
    (chatter=9) [integer]
        Flag  to  set the chattyness at execution.  Default value is set
        to 9, which gives the user the task version  and  few  warnings.
        Lower/higher  values  produces  quieter/verbose  output  on  the 
        screen.
    
    (clobber = yes) [boolean]
        Flag specifying whether or not  a  pre-existing  file  with  the
        same  name  as  that requested as the output file from this task
        will be overwritten.
