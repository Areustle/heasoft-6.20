NAME
    hkscale  --  Scales a FITS  housekeeping  data  file  into  physical
    values.  The file must have already been run through hkexpand.
    
    
USAGE
    hkscale  infile outfile convlist passlist
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task takes the columns of an hkexpand'ed Housekeeping file, and
    uses the appropriate conversion formulae to give them  their  proper
    physical  values.   The conversion types supported are linear, power
    series, text, integer or  real  look-up  tables,  and  user  written
    conversion  functions,  which  must  be included in the source code.
    The user has the option of converting all,  or  only  some,  of  the
    columns,  and  if only some are converted, the rest can be passed to
    the output, or not.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        The file name of the input HKEXPAND'ed HK table.  It is  assumed
        to be in BINTABLE format.
    
    outfile [filename]
        The name of the output, scaled, FITS table.
    
    convlist [string]
        The  list  of  columns  to  be converted, "-" means convert all,
        "@filename" means the list is stored in the file 'filename', one
        column name per line.
    
    passlist [string]
        The  list  of  columns  to be passed unconverted, "-" means pass
        all the rest, and "@filename" means the list is  stored  in  the
        file 'filename', one column name per line.
    
    (cpardir) [string]
        The path to the conversion parameter files, terminated with a /.
    
    (ghk = "hkconv.fits[1]") [string]
        The  file  name and extension number of the conversion parameter
        file for the general HK parameters.
    
    (SIS0 = "hkconv.fits[2]") [string]
        The file name and extension number of the  conversion  parameter
        file for the SIS0 HK parameters.
    
    (SIS1 = "hkconv.fits[3]") [string]
        The  file  name and extension number of the conversion parameter
        file for the SIS1 HK parameters.
    
    (GIS2 = "hkconv.fits[4]") [string]
        The file name and extension number of the  conversion  parameter
        file for the GIS2 HK parameters.
    
    (GIS3 = "hkconv.fits[4]") [string]
        The  file  name and extension number of the conversion parameter
        file for the GIS3 HK parameters.
    
    (name = "PARNAME") [string]
        The column name in the conversion parameter file containing  the
        Housekeeping parameter names.
    
    (type = "PARTYPE") [string]
        The  column name in the conversion parameter file containing the
        Housekeeping parameter types.  At this point only "TEXT",  "INT"
        and "LINEAR" are supported.
    
    (powstem = "POWER") [string]
        The  stem  for  the  column  names  for  linear and power series
        conversions.
    
    (valstem = "VAL") [STRING]
        The stem for the column names for the look-up tables
    
    (copyall = "yes") [boolean]
        If true, all extension are copied from the  input  file  to  the
        output file.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.      Scale the columns HKSTS, RDRST, and pass the columns CCDID and 
            MODE in the HKEXPAND'ed HK file exhk.fits, the new file is schk.fits:
                    
            ft> hkscale exhk.fits schk.fits "HKSTS RDRST" "CCDID MODE"
