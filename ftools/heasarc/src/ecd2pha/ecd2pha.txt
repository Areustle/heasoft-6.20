NAME
    ecd2pha  --  Converts  Einstein  PHA  dataset  in  the format on the
    HEASARC CD-ROM June 1 1992 to OGIP standard PHA file format.
    
    
USAGE
    ecd2pha infile outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
      ECD2PHA converts an Einstein PHA dataset  in  the  format  on  the
    HEASARC  CD-ROM distributed in 1992, July 1, to an OGIP standard PHA
    file format. The resultant file can be used with  existing  software
    such as GRPPHA ,MATHPHA, and RBNPHA.
    
    
    
WARNINGS ON USAGE
    
      This is a beta-test version, use with care.
    
    
    
SUPPORTED FITS FORMATS
    
      Currently  only the following OGIP standards are supported by this
    task:
    
    HDUCLAS1/HDUVERS1 = 'SPECTRUM'/'1.*.*'
            (commonly also known as "PHAVERSN=1992a")
    
    HDUCLAS2 = 'TOTAL'/'NET'/'BKG'
    
    HDUCLAS3 = 'COUNT'/'RATE'
    
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [character string]
         The name of the FITS PHA file to be converted
    
    outfile [character string]
         The name of the FITS file to be written in  OGIP  standard  PHA
        file format
    
    (copyprime = yes) [boolean]
         Whether  to  copy  the  primary  header and array to the output
        file.
    
    (copyall = no) [boolean]
         Whether to copy all other extensions from  the  input  file  to
        the output file.
    
    chatter [integer]
         Flag  to  indicate how chatty the task is at execution. A value
        of  9  is  the   default,  with  lower/higher  values  producing 
        quieter/verbose output  respectively.
    
    (clobber = false) [boolean]
         Flag  specifying  whether  or  not a pre-existing file with the
