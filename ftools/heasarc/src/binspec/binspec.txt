NAME
    binspec - bins vectors by rows
    
    
USAGE
    binspec infile outfile gtifile phasefile timecol column
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task bins a requested portion of a vector column, based  on  an
    optional  good  times  and phases.  The binning can be specified for
    the entire file, or for a subset of good  rows.   The  binning  adds
    the  1st element of the first good row to the 1st element of the 2nd
    good row, etc. to build up a new vector with the same dimensions  as
    the requested input subset.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The  name of the input FITS file (and extension number in square
        brackets) to be binned.
    
    outfile [file name]
        The name of the output FITS file.
    
    gtifile [file name]
        The name and extension of the input GTI  information.   A  blank
        or  '-'  indicates  that  no  good  time  interval  checking  is 
        desired.  The good time intervals are  assumed  to  be  in  time
        order.  Current maximum number of GTIs allowed is 100.
    
    phasefile [file name]
        The  name and extension of the input phase information.  A blank
        or '-' indicates  that  no  phase  checking  is  desired.   This
        facility is not currently available.
    
    timecol = "TIME" [string]
        The  name  of  the  column  in  the input file containing timing
        information.  The value of this input is ignored if no gti  file
        is   specified.    This  value  is  case  sensitive  unless  the 
        "sensecase" parameter is set to "no".  The  value  for  time  is
        assumed to be a double precision scalar.
    
    column = "PHAS" [string]
        The  name of the column in the input file containing the integer
        vector to be binned.  The entire vector will be binned unless  a
        subset  is  specified  as  part  of the column name, enclosed in
        square brackets.  For example, if the user wishes  to  only  bin
        vector  elements  10-20 and 50-100 of a column named "PHAS", the
        value of column should  be  column  =  PHAS[10-20,50-100].   The
        current maximum length of the vector allowed is 1024.
    
    binmode = SUM [string]
        The  type  of  binning to do.  SUM will add all requested values
        and output the sum.  Currently only SUM  is  available.   Future
        enhancements will have MEAN and RATE options.
    
    (rows = '-') [string]
        The  rows  to  include  in  the binning.  A '-' will include all
        rows (the default).  Single  rows  or  groups  of  rows  can  be
        specified.   For  example,  to  select  rows  2, 5 to 10 and 52,
        enter rows = 2,5-10,52.
    
    (binrows = -1) [integer]
        The number of rows to bin together  for  each  output  row.   If
        binrows  is  negative,  the  entire file is binned together (the
        default).  This parameter specifies the number of good  rows  to
        bin  together  rather  than the number of rows in the file.  For
        example, if the phase information only selects every  other  row
        of  the file, the first binrows good rows will be added together
        and output, rather than the first  binrows  of  the  input  file
        (which  would,  in  this  case,  only  consist of binrows/2 good
        rows).
    
    (indate = MJDREF) [string]
        The keyword name containing the zero  start  date  of  the  time
        column  of  the  input file.  If the value of the keyword indate
        is not of the form dd/mm/yy or yyyy-mm-dd,  then  the  value  is
        assumed  to  be  in  terms  of Julian days.  A blank or '-' will
        defeat zero time checking for  ALL  of  the  input  files.   The
        output  file zero time is set equal to the input file zero time,
        and is written in the same keyword as the input file.
    
    (intime = " ") [string]
        The keyword name containing the zero  start  time  of  the  time
        column  of  the  input file.  If the value of the indate keyword
        in not of the form dd/mm/yy or  yyyy-mm-dd,  this  parameter  is
        ignored.
    
    (gtistart = START) [string]
        The  name  of  the  start column of the GTI file.  This value is
        ignored if no GTI file is specified.
    
    (gtistop = STOP) [string]
        The name of the stop column of the  GTI  file.   This  value  is
        ignored if no GTI file is specified.
    
    (gtidate = MJDREF) [string]
        The  keyword  name  containing  the  zero start date of the time
        column of the GTI file.  If the value of the keyword gtidate  is
        not  of  the  form  dd/mm/yy  or  yyyy-mm-dd,  then the value is
        assumed to be in terms of Julian days.   A  blank  or  '-'  will
        defeat zero time checking for the GTI file only.
    
    (gtitime = " ") [string]
        The  keyword  name  containing  the  zero start time of the time
        column of the GTI file.  If the value of the gtidate keyword  in
        not  of  the  form  dd/mm/yy  or  yyyy-mm-dd,  this parameter is
        ignored.
    
    (epoch = "PH_EPOCH") [string]
        The keyword name containing the phase  epoch  (start  time)  for
        this phase file.
    
    (period = "PH_PRD") [string]
        The keyword name containing the period for this phase file.
    
    (phstart = "START") [string]
        The  name  of  the phase start column.  Values in the column are
        assumed to be in units of fraction of phase (i.e. between 0  and
        1).
        
        (phstop = "STOP") [string]
            The  name  of  the  phase stop column.  Values in the column
            are assumed to be  in  units  of  fraction  of  phase  (i.e.
            between 0 and 1).
        
        (phdate = MJDREF) [string]
            The  keyword name containing the zero start date of the time
            related keywords in the phase file.  If  the  value  of  the
            keyword  phdate  is  not of the form dd/mm/yy or yyyy-mm-dd,
            then the value is assumed to be in terms of Julian days.   A
            blank  or  '-'  will defeat zero time checking for the phase
            file only.
        
        (phtime = " ") [string]
            The keyword name containing the zero start time of the  time
            related  keywords  in  the  phase file.  If the value of the
            phdate keyword in not of the form  dd/mm/yy  or  yyyy-mm-dd,
            this parameter is ignored.
        
        (outcol = " ") [string]
            The  name(s)  of  the  output columns.  If blank or '-', the
            name of the requested input column(s) are used.
        
        (copycol = no) [boolean]
            Whether to copy the  value  of  the  other  columns  to  the
            output  file.  The value of the other columns is taken to be
            the value of that column in the same row as the  first  good
            input vector of a sum.
        
        (copyprime = yes) [boolean]
            Whether  to  copy the primary header and array to the output
            file.
        
        (copyall = no) [boolean]
            Whether to copy all other extensions from the input file  to
            the output file.
        
        (history = yes) [boolean]
            Whether to output history records to the output file.
        
        (sensecase = yes) [boolean]
            Whether to be case sensitive for the input column names.
        
        
EXAMPLES
    1.   Sum  all  the  values in the PHAS column in the file input.fits
    and write the values to output.fits
    
         ft> binspec input.fits output.fits '-' '-' '-' PHAS
    
    2.  As above, but specify  good  time  interval  file  gti.fits  and
    phase  information  file  phase.fits, and only bin elements 1-64 and
    128-256 of the input vector
    
         ft> binspec input.fits output.fits gti.fits phase.fits TIME PHAS[1-64,128-256]
    
    
    
NOTES:
    The zero dates must all be of the same format,  either  julian  days
    or dd/mm/yy or yyyy-mm-dd, where the two digit year yy means 19yy.
