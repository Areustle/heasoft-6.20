DESCRIPTION:
    
    This task extracts a Radial  Point-Spread  Function  (RPSF)  dataset
    from  an  event  file.   An  RPSF  dataset consists of the number of
    counts per unit area as  a  function  of  radius  (using  series  of
    concentric  annulus).   This  is calculated using the X & Y (ie RA &
    dec) columns in the event file centered on a point  defined  by  the
    user  (in  either  RA & dec or pixel coordinates) for a user-defined
    number of annuli and outer-radius.  If desired, the  user  can  also
    specify  the  radius  (within the outer radius) beyond which will be
    used to estimate the number of counts per  unit  area  corresponding
    to  the  background.  The  user  can  also  specify  any  of several
    prescriptions  to  be  used  to  calculate  the  statistical  errors 
    associated  with  the  RPSF  data.   Another option is possible that
    user can define region file to exclude region(s).   Six  shapes  are
    supported  at  present:  CIRCLE,  BOX, POLYGON, POINT, ELLIPSE,  and
    ANNULUS.
    
    NOTE: region file is used ONLY to exclude regions from input file.
    
    
    
CALCULATION & PROGATION OF ERRORS
    
    There are several options open to users regarding the calculation or
    propagation  of  errors,  controlled  by  the  parameters  error and
    properr.
    
    The  error  parameter  controls  which  prescription  is   used   to 
    calculate  errors,  should the task need to do so. The value of this
    keyword is therefore important if the errors are to be propagated.
    
    The hidden parameter (properr='yes' by default) is used to  know  if
    Poissonian  statistics  should  be used to calculate the statistical
    errors, or if errors are not to be propagated (properr='no').
    
    Currently, the following prescriptions are available. If  N  is  the
    number of counts observed in a given radial bin, then:
    
    ERROR = 'Gauss'
        whereby the errors are calculated using SQRT(N).
    
    ERROR = 'POISS-1'(the default) 
        whereby  the  algorithm  of  Gehrels  (1986 ApJ, 303, 336) eqn 7
        with S=1 is used:
           error = 1.0 + SQRT(N + 0.75)
        The value is statistically that of the (larger) +ve error  of  a
        Poissonian  distribution,  but  within  this  task this value is
        assigned to both the +ve and -ve error on  the  counts  in  that
        channel.   For   small   N,   the   errors  created  using  this 
        prescription  is   significantly   GREATER   (and   hence   more 
        conservative)  than  both  the true -ve error, and that obtained
        by  simply  using   SQRT(N).    Thus,   this   prescription   is 
        recommended  unless a user fully understands the implications of
        using a different prescription. Both differences quickly  reduce
        as  one  moves  to  larger  N  (and  the Poissonian distribution
        becomes more symmetric/Gaussian).
    
    ERROR = 'POISS-2'
        whereby the algorithm of Gehrels (1986 ApJ, 303,  336)  eqn  11,
        with S=1 is used.
           error = SQRT(N - 0.25)
        The  value is statistically that of the (smaller) -ve error of a
        Poissonian distribution, but within  this  task  this  value  is
        assigned  to  both  the  +ve and -ve error on the counts in that
        channel. This error prescription UNDERESTIMATES  the  error  for
        small N.
        
    
    ERROR = 'POISS-3'
        whereby  the  mean  of  the  errors given by POISS-1 and POISS-2
        above is used.
    Caution is urged, particularly when  using  ERRMETH  =  'Gauss',  as
    unexpected   and/or   misleading   results   can  be  produced.  See 
    OGIP/95-008 for further details.

    The parameter properr (hidden) controls whether the errors are to be
    propagated during the  algebra  or  (if  properr='no')  whether  the
    errors  are simply calculated from the resultant PHA dataset. In the
    former case, the errors are propagated in the normal manner (err3  =
    SQRT[err1**2  +  err2**2]).   This  is  an approximation when in the
    Poissonian regime (ie for  low  N).  Whilst  it  is  true  that  the
    variances  of  the  Poissonian  distribution  are  combined  in this
    normal way, confidence limit error bars are not  simply  related  to
    the variance like they are for Gaussian statistics.
    
    HOWEVER,  these approximations work well for all but the smallest N,
    and is certainly superior to  either  assuming  SQRT(N)  errors,  or
    neglecting errors altogther:
    For example, adding two PHA datasets each with N=5 counts in a given
    channel will give a value of 10, and errors of:
       +4.24   -4.24   (using error='POISS-1')
       +3.08   -3.08   (using error='POISS-2')
       +3.95   -3.95   (using error='POISS-3')
    compared to:
       +4.27   -3.11   (statistically correct values)
       +3.16   -3.16   (propagating 'Gaussian' errors)
    
    Severely  misleading  and/or  incorrect  results are possible if the
    errors are not propagated (ie if   properr=no).  Turning  off  error
    propagation   is   only   reccomended   when   one   is  adding  non 
    background-subtracted datasets, and one fully understands the risks.
    
    
    
CALCULATION OF AREA WEIGHTING FACTOR 
    
    The radial bin to which each event is assigned is determined by  the
    annulus  in  which  the center of that pixel lies (ie events are NOT
    "split" between annuli according to the fraction of the  pixel  area
    in  each).  This  results  in an "active" area in a given radial bin
    running from R_lo to R_hi slightly different from the  pi*(R_hi^2  -
    R_lo^2)  expected  from  purely  geometrical  considerations.   This 
    difference is clearly greatest in the innermost  radial  bins.   The
    so-called  "Area  weighting  factor",  defined  as  the ratio of the
    active  area  within  each  annulus  to  the  geometrical  area,  is 
    therefore  calculated  within  the  task, used in the calculation of
    the RPSF (counts per unit area) and  written  to  the  output  file.
    Whilst  strictly  the area weighting factor should be calculated for
    all radial bins,  its  determination  can  be  rather  CPU-intensive
    under  many  circumstances.  However,  assuming that the radial bins
    are larger than the pixel size, the area weighting factor  tends  to
    unity  towards the outer radial bins.  Thus the run-time of the task
    can be greatly reduced  by  setting  area_wgt_option=2,  calculating
    the  area weighting factor within a user-defined radius wgt_rad, and
    assuming  it  is  unity  at  larger  radii.   This  option  is  only 
    suggested   for  "quick-looks"  at  the  RPSF  profile,  but  it  is 
    recommended an RPSF is re-extracted  with  area_wgt_option=1  should
    the RPSF warrant further detailed analysis.

    None 
        
        
PARAMETERS:
    
    evtfil [character string]
        The name of the input event file.
    
    rpsfil [character string]

    coordsys [character string] 
        The  name  of  the  coordinate  system  the  input  centroid  is 
        supposed  to  be.   If  this  is  in pixel coordinate then it is
        'IMAGE' system and if the input is in  RA  and  DEC  (fractional
        degrees) coordinate system is 'CELESTIAL'.
    
    x_in [real]
        The  centroid  of  the  event.   If  'IMAGE',  then  it  is  the 
        x-coordinate of the pixel, and if 'CELESTIAL' it  is  the  Right
        Ascension (in fraction of degrees) of the event.
    
    y_in [real] 
        The  centroid  of  the  event.   If  'IMAGE',  then  it  is  the 
        y-coordinate  of  the  pixel,  and  if  'CELESTIAL'  it  is  the 
        Declination (in fraction of degrees) of the event.
    
    chanmin [integer]
        Minimum  PI channel number.  This is required for the ROSAT PSPC
        and gives the lowest PI channel to  be  used  to  construct  the
        radial  profile.
    
    chanmax [integer]
        Maximum  PI  channel number. This is required for the ROSAT PSPC
        and gives  the highest PI channel to be used  to  construct  the
        radial profile.
    
    rad_length [real]
        Total  Radial  length  through which the RPSF is requested. This
        length must be entered in unit of arc-min.
    
    bkgrnd_pres [boolean]
        This  parameter  determines  whether  the  user  would  like  to 
        calculate  back-ground  counts.   If  YES/yes  then  it asks for
        inner radius for background calculation.
    
    bck_rad [real]
        Background radius in arcmin.  The program  will  use  the  total
        number   of  counts  in  a  circular  annulus  from  bck_rad  to 
        rad_length as an estimate of the number of background counts.
    
    nbins [integer]
        Total number of bins user wants to be divide  the  whole  region
        into.  This number should be less than 1000.
    
    error [character string]
        Error to be chosen by the user. Three different options of error
        calculation is provided.
    
        Gaussian error:
        1. error = SQRT(N)
    
        Poisson error:
        2. error = 1.0 + SQRT(N + 0.75)
    
        3. error = SQRT(N - 0.25)
    
        4. mean of the errors given by 2. and 3. above  is  used,  i.e.,
                  (1.0+SQRT(N+0.75))+(SQRT(N-0.25))
                 -----------------------------------
                                2
        
    
    (properr=true) [boolean]
        This  flag  is for calculation of propagation error which is set
        to true by default.
    
    areawgt [boolean]
        This flag is for calculation of the area  weighting  factor.  If
        this  is  set  to  YES/yes,  the  area  weighting factor will be
        calculated and otherwise skip this calculation.
    
    area_wgt_option [string]
        Two options are  provided  for  calculation  of  area  weighting
        factor.   area weighting for the entire region(option=1) or upto
        a certain distance from the center  of  the  event  region  only
        (option=2).   In  case  of  option=2, it then asks for the outer
        radius for this calculation.
    
    wgt_rad [integer]
        If area weighting is wanted upto a  certain  distance  from  the
        center  of  a  event,  then  it asks for the radial distance (in
        arc-min) through which it is required to be calculated
    
    region_pres [boolean]
        Whether calculation to be done with region file included
    
    regfil [string]
        If region_pres is YES/yes, then is asked for  the  name  of  the
        ascii   region   file.   This  is  region  file  extracted  from 
        saoimage.  The region file is used to  define  EXCLUDED  region,
        if  any.  It  is immaterial of the sign(-,+ or !) preceeding the
        region.  Region file is used for only  excluding  the  specified
        region.
    
    (chatter=9) [integer]
        Flag  to  set the chattyness at execution.  Default value is set
        to 9, which gives the user the task version  and  few  warnings.
        Lower/higher  values  produces  quieter/verbose  output  on  the 
        screen.
    
    (clobber = false) [boolean]
        Flag specifying whether or not  a  pre-existing  file  with  the
        same  name  as  that requested as the output file from this task
        will be overwritten.
