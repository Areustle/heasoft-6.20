<h2>NAME</h2>

searchflickpix -- Search for anomalous 'flickering' pixels 
in event files from CCD-type detectors


<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>searchflickpix infile outfile cellsize impfac logporb1 logprob2 
bthresh </tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
'searchflickpix' is a mission-independent task that reads an input event
file to search for flickering pixels, which are pixels that exhibit
anomalous pulse height over a short period of time (usually less than an
observation) and are caused by radiation damage on a semiconductor
detector.  The tool outputs a file containing events affected by the
detected flickering pixels in the first 'EVENTS' extension.  If the
parameter 'cleanimg=yes', then the converse is recorded, the clean events
not affected by flickering pixels.  In the second 'PIXELS' extension, the
location of each flickering pixel is recorded, along with the number of
counts, duration, and average pulse height of the flickering pixel.  This
task is based on the ftool 'cleansis', originally developed for the ASCA
SIS, but it is significantly altered from the original tool to have more
universality and flexibility.  It is a mission-independent tool, but is
meant to be used for event data from CCD-type detectors, like ASCA SIS and
Suzaku XIS.
</p>

<p>
The main routine for flickering pixel detection is a two-stage process,
similar to that in the ASCA task 'cleansis'.  This procedure is performed
separately for each detector chip as specified by the 'chipcol',
'firstchip', and 'lastchip' parameters.  After the event file is read,
event counts in each pixel are compared to the mean counts in the full
chip, and the pixels where the Poisson probability (calculated using
'impfac') exceeds the threshold given by the 'logprob1' parameter are
flagged.  The pixel locations for this comparison are defined by the 'xcol'
and 'ycol' parameters.  Next, the counts in each pixel are compared to the
pixels in a surrounding box of size ('cellsize' x 'cellsize'), and
anomalous pixels are flagged similarly to the first step but with another
Poisson probability parameter, 'logprob2'. If the surrounding pixels yield
no counts, a zero background threshold specified by the parameter 'bthresh'
is applied instead.  This second Poisson search is repeated if
'iterate=yes'.  Last, if 'flagedge=yes', pixels along the chip edges are
flagged as flickering pixels for the full duration of the observation.
</p>

<p>
The input events can be filtered several ways before the flickering pixel
search is done.  By changing 'chanmin' and 'chanmax', a pulse-height filter
(&gt;= chanmin &amp;&amp; $lt;= chanmax) is applied to the events used for
the flickering pixel search.  These parameters are ignored if
'chancol=NONE'.  Similarly, spatial filters can be applied with 'xmin',
'xmax', 'ymin', and 'ymax'.  The default parameter settings uses the
TLMIN and TLMAX header keywords corresponding to the appropriate column,
effectively applying no filter.  A grade filter may be applied
using the 'gradecol' and 'grade' parameters.  Finally, the 'n_division'
parameter may be used to divide the observation into equally-spaced 
time bins and search each duration separately.  This is useful to search
for short-duration flickering pixels that might not be flagged in a long
observation with high background signal.
</p>

<p>
The parameter 'cellsize' must be an odd integer or zero, and it is
recommended to be about 1/4 of the PSF size, or 7 pixels for SXI.
If 'cellsize=0', a simple counts-per-pixel cutoff is applied, so any pixels
in the chip image containing more than 'bthresh' counts are flagged as
flickering.  The recommended value for 'logprob1' is log10(1/chipsize),
where 'chipsize' is the total number of pixels in a single detector chip.
This is about -5.6 for SXI.  For these values, 'bthresh=3' 3 is
recommended, although a lower threshold may be set based on the expected
background rate.
</p>

<p>

<p>
After the flickering pixels are determined, and as an update from cleansis,
this tool calculates and outputs to the 'PIXELS' extension a time duration
(or START and STOP) when the flickering events are observed for each
detected pixel.  This function is disabled when the parameter
'timecol=NONE'.  In most cases, START and STOP might be identical to TSTART
(observation start time) and TSTOP (observation stop time), respectively.
However, given that flickering pixels are not persistent but repeat on
timescale ranging from hours to days, the duration can be shorter than the
entire observation time, especially for a long-exposure observation.  If
the parameter 'duration=yes', a detailed duration search is performed for
to determine how long each flickering pixel is actually flickering. This
information is output as the FRACTION column in the 'PIXEL' extension, and
it is the fraction of time the pixel flickers between START and STOP.  The
time-averaged pulse height in each flickering pixel is also output to the
'PIXELS' extension unless the parameter 'chancol=NONE'.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<p>
<dt>infile [filename]</dt>
<dd>Input event file.  The 'EVENTS' extension must be present.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>outfile [filename]</dt>
<dd>Output event file.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(timecol = TIME) [string]</dt>
<dd>Time column (or NONE).  This column provides the time information used
to determine first and last times when flickering events occur in each
detected flickering pixel, outputting 'START' and 'STOP' columns in the
'PIXELS' extension.  If set to NONE, this time dependence is disabled.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(chipcol = CCD_ID) [string]</dt>
<dd>Chip column (or NONE).  If set to NONE, then all events are searched
together for flickering pixels.  Otherwise, events are searched separately
by 'chipcol' grouping.  For an instrument with one physical detector per
event list, the parameter should be set to NONE; for instruments with
multiple detectors in a single events list, the proper column name should
be specified.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(xcol = ACTX) [string]</dt>
<dd>X coordinate column.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(ycol = ACTY) [string]</dt>
<dd>Y coordinate column.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(chancol = PI) [string]</dt>
<dd>Pulse height column (or NONE).  The tool calculates the average pulse
height values of the flickering events for each detected pixel, and outputs
this as the 'chancol' (e.g., 'PI') column in the 'PIXELS' extension.  If
set to NONE, this feature is disabled and the column is not output.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(gradecol = GRADE) [string]</dt>
<dd>Event grade column (or NONE).  If this name is specified, only events
with specific grade(s) given in the 'grade' parameter are used in
accumulating the chip image for flickering pixel search.  If set to NONE,
all grades are used, and the 'grade' parameter is ignored.
</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(grade = 0) [string]</dt>
<dd>Event grade(s) for clean (or ALL).  This should be a list of grade
values to use in accumulating the chip image for the flickering pixel
search.  Values should be comma-separated, and ranges can be specified by a
dash.  For example, 'grade=0,2,3,4,6' and 'grade=0,2-4,6' are equivalent.
If set to ALL, all grades are used.  This is the same result as
setting 'gradecol=NONE', and if that is specified, the setting of the grade
parameter is ignored.</dd>
</p>

<dt>(n_division = 1) [integer]</dt>
<dd>Divide total observation time into the given number.</dd>

set to 0, this invokes the simple counts-per-pixel cutoff.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>impfac [real]</dt>
<dd>Impact factor for gamma function.  This is used for the Poisson search,
and in 'cleansis' it has been a fixed value of 320.</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>logprob1 [real]</dt>
<dd>The LOG (base 10) of the Poisson probability threshold for the
first-step flickering pixel search (using the entire chip).  It must be

<dt>logprob2 [real]</dt>
<dd>The LOG (base 10) of the Poisson probability threshold for the
second-step flickering pixel search (comparing to the surrounding pixels).
It must be negative. If 'cellsize=0', this parameter is ignored.</dd>
</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<ol>

<li> Detect flickering pixels from an SXI event file using a 5x5 background
cell and a 3 count-zero background threshold.  The output file contains the
"flickering pixels" (not cleaned events, as was output by cleansis) in the
'EVENTS' extension. 
<pre>
searchflickpix infile="input.evt" outfile="output_flickering.evt" \
     cellsize=7 impfrac=320 logprob1=-5.6 logprob2=-5.6 bthresh=3
</pre>
</li>

<li> Same as above, but write out the cleaned (non-flickering) event
list in the output file. 
<pre>
searchflickpix infile="input.evt" outfile="output_clean.evt" \
     cellsize=7 impfrac=320 logprob1=-5.6 logprob2=-5.6 bthresh=3 cleanimg=yes
</pre>
</li>

<li> Same as example 1, but a Suzaku XIS event file is used as input. Each
XIS event file contains data from one CCD, but with a larger chip size
(1024x1024).
<pre>
searchflickpix infile="input_xis.evt" outfile="output_flickering.evt" \
     cellsize=5 impfrac=320 logprob1=-6.0 logprob2=-6.0 bthresh=3 \
     chipcol=NONE xcol=DETX ycol=DETY
</pre>
</li>

<li> Clean an event file to global fixed threshold of 20 counts per pixel.
Exclude PHA values greater than 1200.
<pre>
searchflickpix infile="input.evt" outfile="output_clean.evt" \
     cellsize=0 impfrac=320 logprob1=-6.0 logprob2=-6.0 bthresh=20 \
     chancol=PHA chanmin=0 chanmax=1200 cleanimg=yes
</pre>
</li>
