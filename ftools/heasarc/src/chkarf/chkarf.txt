NAME
    chkarf  --  Checks  the  validity  of  the  mandatory  and  optional 
    keywords of an ARF FITS file before input to XSPEC.
    
    
USAGE
    chkarf infile=filename1 outfile=filename2 [chatter=11]
    or,
    chkarf filename1 outfile=filename2
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The  task  performs the necessary checks, e.g, validity of mandatory
    and optional keywords, on an input FITS file  of  spectral  response
    to  determine  whether  it is in the correct format to be acceptable
    as an input  to  XSPEC  (and  hence  several  other  ftools  tasks),
    reporting  back  to  STDOUT  (and/or an ASCII file) the results.  To
    get report to STDOUT, user needs to use chatter >=10 .
    
    The mandatory keyword checked are:
    
    EXTNAME, TELESCOP, INSTRUME, FILTER & ARFVERSN
    
    The optional keyword checked are:
    
    PHAFILE, HDUCLASS, HDUCLAS1, HDUCLAS2, HDUVERS1 & HDUVERS2
    
    NOTE: Optional  keywords  are  suggested,  as  they  supply  further
    detailed informations regarding data sets.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [character string]
        The input file name containing response matrix data.
    
    (outfile = arf.log) [character string]
        The  name  of  the  output  log  file  name.   Default is set to
        'arf.log'.  If user wants to use other output  file  name,  then
        one has to type outfile=filename in the command line.
    
    (chatter=9) [integer]
        Flag  to  set the chattyness at execution.  Default value is set
        to 9, which gives the user the task version  and  few  warnings.
        Lower/higher  values  produces  quieter/verbose  output  on  the 
        screen.
    
    (clobber = yes) [boolean]
        Flag specifying whether or not  a  pre-existing  file  with  the
        same  name  as  that requested as the output file from this task
        will be overwritten.
