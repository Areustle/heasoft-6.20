NAME
    arf2arf1 - convert a Type 2 ARF file to a Type 1 ARF file

    
USAGE
    arf2arf1 infile outfile

    
DESCRIPTION
    The Ancillary Response File (ARF) is used in combination with the
    detector Redistribution Matrix File (RMF) by the XSPEC spectral
    fitting package. In a Type 2 ARF file multiple ARFs are packed into
    a single binary table, one per row.  A Type 1 ARF file, on the other
    hand, only contains a single ARF in each binary table extension.
    The process of converting a Type 2 ARF to a Type 1 ARF involves
    expanding each row of the Type 2 file into a separate binary table
    extension in the Type 1 file.

    Both types of ARF tables contain 3 columns containing floating point
    data values: 'ENERG_LO', 'ENERG_HI', and 'SPECRESP'.  The difference
    is that these are scalar columns in Type 1 files and vector columns
    in Type 2 files.  The 3 vectors in the Type 2 file must have the same
    length.  The number of rows in the output Type 1 ARF table extensions
    will be equal to the length of the vectors in the Type 2 files.


PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        The name of the input Type 2 ARF file.
    
    outfile [filename]
        The name of the output Type 1 ARF file.  Precede it with an
        exclamation point, '!', to force fcopy to overwrite a preexisting
        file of the same name.

    (rows = "-") [string]
        Range of rows to be processed in the input ARF 2 table.
        For example, "1-5,10" will process the first 5 rows as well
        as the 10th row.  By default every row of the input file will
        be processed.  Each row will be converted into a separate ARF
        1 table extension in the output file.

    (energ_lo = ENERG_LO) [string]
        The name of the column containing the lower energy range.

    (energ_hi = ENERG_HI) [string]
        The name of the column containing the upper energy range.

    (specresp = SPECRESP) [string]
        The name of the column containing the spectral response.

EXAMPLES
    1.  Convert the input Type 2 ARF to a Type 1 ARF
