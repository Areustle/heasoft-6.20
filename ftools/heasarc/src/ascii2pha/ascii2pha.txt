DESCRIPTION
    
      ASCII2PHA creates an OGIP standard PHA FITS  file  from  an  ascii
    dataset.   The  user  can  apply  Poissonian errors if desired. This
    task creates a basic PHA file, it does not allow the user to  define
    a grouping, systematic errors, or add any quality flags.
    
    
    
WARNINGS ON USAGE
    
      This  is  a  beta-test  version,  although this task performs some
    error checking, it should be used with care.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [character string]
         The name of the ASCII file containing the PHA dataset
    
    outfile [character string]
         The name of the FITS file to be written
    
    chanpres [boolean]
         If channel numbers are present in the input file, enter yes
    
    dtype [integer]
         The PHA dataset can be defined in counts or rate  (counts/sec).
        This   parameter  is  a  flag  to  allow the user to define what
        datatype the  input dataset is in. 1 counts, 2 - rate.
    
    qerror [boolean]
         "yes" if errors are present in dataset.
    
    rows = - [integer]
         The range of rows to be read from the ascii file.  The  default
        "-"  means  read  all  the  rows.  This  enables  users  to skip
        comments in the ascii file. rows=-10  specifies  rows  upto  and
        including  10,  and similiarly rows=10- specifies rows 10 to the
        last row.
    
    fchan [integer]
         This parameter is only prompted for if chanpres=no, it  is  the
        first channel number in the ascii file.
    
    tlmin [integer]
         This  is  the  first  legal Detector channel. NOTE: This is not
        the same as fchan.
    
    detchans [integer]
         The number of legal Detector channels.
    
    pois [boolean]
         Yes, if Poissonian errors are to be applied to the dataset.
    
    telescope [character string]
         Telescope name.
    
    instrume [character string]
         Instrument name.
    
    detnam [character string]
         Detector name.
    
    filter [character string]
         Filter name, enter NONE if approriate.
    
    (phaversn = 1.1.0) [character string]
         OGIP PHA version to be created.
    
    exposure [real]
         Exposure time in seconds.
    
    (areascal = 1) [real]
         Area scaling factor.
    
    (backscal = 1) [real]
         Background scaling factor.
    
    (corrscal = 1) [real]
         Correction scaling factor.
    
    (corrfile = ) [character string]
         Associated correction file.
    
    (backfile = ) [character string]
         Associated background file.
    
    (respfile = ) [character string]
         Associated redistribution matrix file.
    
    (ancrfile = ) [character string]
         Associated ancillary file.
    
    (date_obs = ) [character string]
         UTC Date of observation start, in the forms  of  yyyy-mm-dd  or
        dd/mm/yy.
    
    (time_obs = ) [character string]
         UTC Time of observation start, in the form hh:mm:ss
    
    (date_end = ) [character string]
         UTC  Date  of  observation  end,  in  the  form  yyyy-mm-dd  or 
        dd/mm/yy.
    
    (time_end = ) [character string]
         UTC Time of observation end, in the form hh:mm:ss
    
    (ra_obj = ) [character string]
         RA of Object, in the form hh mm ss
    
    (dec_obj = ) [character string]
         Dec of Object, in the form hh mm ss
    
    (equinox = 2000.0) [real]
         Equinox of RA & Dec measurements
    
    (hduclas2 = UNKNOWN) [character string]
         HDUCLAS2 keyword value
    
    (chantype = ) [character string]
        Channels assigned by Detector electronics
    
    (chatter = 9) [integer]
         Flag to specify how verbose the screen output is,  lower/higher
        chatter flag produces quieter/more verbose display.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
         If yes then an existing file can be overwritten.
