DESCRIPTION
    
    IMPORTANT:  If  you  are  using  US  Rev0  data to create PHA files,
    please see KNOWN BUGS below. There  is  a  serious  error  condition
    which you must work around.
    
    This  program  generates  an  Ancillary  Response File (ARF) for the
    ROSAT  PSPC.   The  ARF  consists  of  a  simple  1-d  list  of  the 
    corrections  which need to be applied to the input detector response
    matrix during the spectral analysis of input PHA  dataset.  The  ARF
    contains  all  corrections  to  the  redistribution matrix file (the
    RMF) due to vignetting of the mirror, filter responses, etc.
    
    
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    phafil [file name]
        The input FITS PHA  file.   Must  contain  either  an  Off  Axis
        Histogram  extension  or  a  WMAP in the primary HDU to describe
        pointing of the instrument.
    
    rmffil [file name]
        The input RMF file.  Can type 'CALDB' to query the CALDB  for  a
        default RMF file.
    
    outfil [file name]
        The  output  ARF  file.  (!<filename>  will  overwrite  existing 
        output file <filename>.)
    
    crffil [file name]
        The primary calibration response file (PCRF).   Must  be  either
        an  XRT  Effective  area  file (EAR) or a Spectral Response File
        (SPECRESP).  Can type 'CALDB' to query the CALDB for  a  default
        SPECRESP  file,  if  the  database can't find one, pcarf asks it
        for an appropriate EAR file.
    
    gefil [file name]
        The instrument Gas Efficiency (GE) file (a  CRF).   Needed  only
        if  PCRF is an EAR file. Can type 'CALDB' to query the CALDB for
        a default GE file.
    
    wtfil [file name]
        The instrument Window Transmission (WT) file  (a  CRF).   Needed
        only  if  PCRF  is  an  EAR  file. Can type 'CALDB' to query the
        CALDB for a default WT file.
    
    fltfil [file name]
        A filter transmission (FLT)  file.   Needed  only  if  PHA  file
        specifies  a  filter.  Can type 'CALDB' to query the CALDB for a
        default FLT file.
    
    (chatter = 10) [integer]
        How much do you want to know.  (0 dead silent: only fatal errors
        reported, 5 quiet,10 normal,15 high,>20 silly)
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        Whether to overwrite an existing output file.
    
    (arfversn = 1.1.0) [string]
        Version number of output ARF file.
    
    (mincnts = 1) [integer]
        Minimum   counts   per   bin   in   WMAP  for  consideration  in 
        processing.  One is recommended value unless run-time becomes  a
        problem  or  source area to WMAP area ratio is very small (which
        would be a peculiar situation anyway).
    
    (deltax = 0) [real]
        Allows CDELT1 keyword in PHA  file  to  be  overridden  (for  US
        Rev0, set to 2.595021e-4)
    
    (deltay = 0) [real]
        Allows  CDELT2  keyword  in  PHA  file  to be overridden (for US
        Rev0, set to 2.595021e-4)
    
    (optaxisx) (optaxisy) 
        Do not remove cover.  No user serviceable parts inside.
    
    (optaxisx) (optaxisy) 
        Do not remove cover.  No user serviceable parts inside.
    
    
EXAMPLES:
    To make  an  ARF  file  using  your  own  XRT  effective  area  file
    (my.eff_area) and getting everything else from the CALDB.  No filter
    used in the observation.   Overwrite  an  existing  output  file  if
    present.
    
    ft>pcarf something.pha CALDB !something.pha my.eff_area CALDB   CALDB
    
    First  CALDB  =  RMF  file, Second CALDB = GE file, Third CALDB = WT
    file
    
    To make an ARF file using the CALDB defaults. The BORON  filter  was
    used  during  the observation.  Overwrite an existing output file if
    present.
    
    ft>pcarf somethingelse.pha CALDB somethingelse.pha CALDB fltfil=CALDB \
    ft>clobber=yes
    
    First CALDB = RMF file, Second CALDB = SPECRESP file, Third CALDB  =
    FLT file
    
    To  make  an ARF file using your own files.  No filter. Do not allow
    overwrite of existing output.

KNOWN BUGS
    
    
    IMPORTANT!  US Rev0 format data (but not RDF  data  or  German  data
    which  has  been  converted with GEVT2RDF) does not properly specify
    the size of the pixels in the Detector image.  Because of this,  the
    extractor  (the  program  that xselect uses to make a spectrum) puts
    the wrong pixel size into the  PHA  file.   The  extractor  will  be
    modified  to  cope with this deficiency in US Rev0 data but it isn't
    fixed yet. So if you use US Rev0 data and you use xselect  to  creat
    a  PHA  (spectrum)  file,  you  must  change  the  DELTX  and  DELTY 
    parameters to get a correct answer.
    
    You need to change the CDELT1 and  CDELT2  keywords  to  2.595021e-4
    times  whatever  the  value of your WMREBIN keyword is (usually 15).
    You can use FKEYPRINT to find the value of WMREBIN  and  FPARKEY  to
    put  the  new  value  into  CDELT1  and  CDELT2.   If  you have perl
    installed at your site (and you  probably  do  since  ascascreen  is
    written  in  perl and if you don't, bug your sysadmin to install it)
    the script fixrev0pha will do these changes  for  you  (type  'fhelp
    fixrev0pha' to see the help page).
    
    PHI  angular dependance of CRF calibration datasets is not supported
    yet.
