c
      program bct

c Produce a Barycenter Correction Table from orbit data.

c For ROSAT only.

c BCT reads a ROSAT orbit file and a JPL2000 ephemeris file to produce a
c Barycenter Correction Table that can be used to conver times in an
c event list (or anywhere else) to the solar system barycenter.
c The output table is in 4-column format, with input and corrected times
c in integer and frational parts.  For details see subroutine bctmake.

      subroutine bctinit(in_fil,ou_fil,rastr,decstr
     &                 ,tchat,lchat,eph_fil,ierr)

c Read parameter file for program bct.

c  O  in_fil    (c)  Name of input file
c  O  ou_fil    (c)  name of output file
c  O  rastr     (c)  R.A. string
c  O  decstr    (c)  Declination string
c  O  tchat     (i)  Terminal chattiness
c  O  lchat     (i)  Log chattiness
c  O  eph_fil   (c)  name of JPL 2000 ephemeris file
c  O  ierr      (i)  error status

C
      subroutine bctmake(in_fil,ou_fil,rastr,decstr,eph_fil,ierr)

C  MAKE a Barycenter Correction Table from orbit data.

c  FOR ROSAT ONLY

c This routine does the following:

c 1)  Opens an input file and tries to find out what the file format is.
c     Three formats can be recognized:
c     Old-type US -- checks for EXTNAME = 'SPORB'
c     New-type US -- checks for EXTNAME = 'EPHEM'
c     German      -- no EXTNAME keyword -- checks column names
c     Any number of extensions can be processed up to 1000 (currently).
c     The extensions are then listed on screen and log.

c 2)  Tries to decode the RA and DEC strings given by the user.  If
c     Unsuccessful it exits with an error.

c 3)  Opens the output file.

c 4)  Opens the ephemeris file.  The full ephemeris file name is reconstructed
c     from a system-independent pathname given in bctdef.inc.

c 5)  Writes RA and DEC keywords to the primary header in the output file.

c 6)  Loops though each row of each extension in the orbit file, writing
c     the corresponding barycenter time delay in the output file.  The
c     overall structure of the input orbit file is preserved in the
c     output file.  The columns are arranged in four column format:
c     1 - UNCORRECTED TIME - INTEGER PART
c     2 - UNCORRECTED TIME - FRACTIONAL PART
c     3 - CORRECTED TIME - INTEGER PART
c     4 - CORRECTED TIME - FRACTIONAL PART

c     For each extension in the output file the routine writes TSTART,
c     TSTOP, RA and DEC keywords.

c  I  in_fil    (c)  Name of input file
c  I  ou_fil    (c)  name of output file
c  I  rastr     (c)  R.A. string
c  I  decstr    (c)  Declination string
c  I  eph_fil   (c)  name of JPL 2000 ephemeris file
c  O  ierr      (i)  error status

      subroutine bcread(lui,itype,extn,icols,frow,nrows,jd,frc,reae)

c READ current time (jd) and satellite position (reae) from input orbit file.

c This routine simply reads from the input file according to the value of
c itype.  Times are returned in JD and the satellite vector is in meters.

c  I  lui     (i)  Lu of input file.
c  I  itype   (i)  = 11 for ROSAT old-type; = 12 for ROSAT new-type;
c                  = 13 for ROSAT German file
c  I  extn    (i)  Number of current FITS extension
c  I  icols   (i)  Array of relevant column numbers
c  I  frow    (i)  Current row in the table
c  I  nrows   (i)  Total number of rows in the extension.
c  O  jd      (i)  Julian day
c  O  frc     (d)  Fractional part of JD (between 0 and 1)
c  O  reae    (d)  Satellite position vector (meters)


-------------------------------

      SUBROUTINE AR_JDC(Nd,Nm,Ny,Jd,Ierr)
C
CC  Converty (DD,MM,YY) to Julian day

c This routine came from MIDAS.  It converts input integers for day
c month and year into a double precision Julian Day.

-------------------------------\


      subroutine bcwrite (luo,frow,nrows,jdi,frci,jdo,frco,ftstat)

c WRITE Barycenter Corrections to output fits file.

c  I  luo      (i)  Lu of output FITS file.
c  I  frow     (i)  Current row in the table
c  I  nrows    (i)  Total number of rows in the extension
c  I  jdi      (i)  Input time, integer part, scc corrected but not bary
c  I  frci     (d)  Input time, real    part, scc corrected but not bary
c  I  jdo      (i)  Input time, integer part, scc corrected and     bary
c  I  frco     (d)  Input time, real    part, scc corrected and     bary
