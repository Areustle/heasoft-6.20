NAME
    roscc2utc --> given the space craft clock time,  it  calculates  the
    utc time in JD, MJD, yyyy-mm-dd:hr:min:sec
    
    
USAGE:
    roscc2utc scctime
    
    
DESCRIPTION:
    
    This  task  converts  the given space craft clock time to UTC in JD,
    MJD, yyyy-mm-dd:hr:min:sec
    
    
    
PARAMETERS:
    
    scctime [real]
        The scc time required to convert
    
    sccfil [character string]
        The name of the input FITS file containing  the  table  of  time
        conversion
    
    (chatter = 9) [integer]
        Flag  to  set the chattyness at execution.  Default value is set

EXAMPLE:
    
    
    % roscc2utc
    Please enter SCC time[] 123456789
     ** roscc2utc 1.1.2
