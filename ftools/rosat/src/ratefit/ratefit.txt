DESCRIPTION
    Ratefit fits the PSPC observation  light curves  produced by rate in
    seven   broad  pulse-height  bands.  The light curves are assumed to
    consist  of  a  flat  cosmic  component,  the  calibrated   particle 
    background  component, a linear scaling of the scattered solar X-ray
    component computed by the  program  AO,  and  a  polynomial  (up  to
    fourth-order)   describing   the  long-term  enhancement  background 
    component.  The constant cosmic background component is fit as  part
    of  the polynomial.  The linear scale factor for the scattered solar
    X-rays (first-order polynomial coefficients)  and  the  fourth-order
    polynomial  coefficients  of  the  long-term enhancement plus cosmic
    background components are fit by the program.
    
    

    The RATEFIT package uses the following input files.
    
    1) Observation  data fits files : none
    2)   Other  fixed  input  :  valid_times_all.dat  from  the  program 
    VALID_TIMES,   RATE1.DAT   and  RATE2.DAT  from  the  program  RATE, 
    AO_SSX_SC.OUT from the program AO.
    
    Interactive Input: 1)  Band  control:  input  1-7  for  pulse-height
    bands  R1-R7.   For  this program, selecting 1 will serve for either
    band R1 or band R1L, as selected by the gain control of the  program
    RATE  (i.e.,  for  the gain parameter 1 band R1 is produced, for the
    gain parameter 2 or 3, band R1L is  produced).   2)  Guess  for  the
    constant  coefficient  of the fourth-order polynomial - if the guess
    is non-zero, the program will query whether the  coefficient  should
    be  fixed  (enter  1)  or  not  (enter 0). If the guess is zero, the
    program  fixes  the  parameter  at  zero.   3-6)  Guesses  for   the 
    remaining  coefficients  of the polynomial - see 2) above.  7) Guess
    for the constant coefficient of the first-order polynomial  for  the
    scattered  solar  X-ray background - see 2) above.  8) Guess for the
    linear coefficient of the first-order polynomial for  the  scattered
    solar X-ray background - see 2) above.
    
    Screen  Output:  The  program  lists time offset (T0) and the values
    for the fitted parameters (I0 - I4 for the  fourth-order  polynomial
    and  IS0  and IS1 for the linear scale factor) along with the formal
    uncertainties   and   chi   square   statistics.    Note   that    a  
    statistically-significant  chi-square is not necessary.  The goal is
    to get a reasonable fit  to  the  general  variation  of  the  light
    curve,   not  to  model  the  detailed  variations  (e.g.,  see  the 
    description for RATE).  The values I0 -  I4  will  be  used  in  the
    program  LTE  while  the  values  IS0  and  IS1  will be used in the
    program TILT.  T0 will be used in both.
    
    Ascii Output: 1) A QDP plot file is written with the name plot_n.qdp
    where  n  refers  to  the  band  which was fit.  This plot should be
    examined to verify the quality of the fit and to  identify  possible
    short-term  background  enhancements  that  should be excluded.  The
    specific times of  background  enhancements  can  be  identified  by
    using  the  RATE1.DAT  and  RATE2.DAT,  which  have the S/C time and
    count rates in the individual bands.
