DESCRIPTION
      Program  AO  uses  the  methods  described in Snowden and Freyberg
      (1993,  ApJ, 404, 403)   to estimate the nominal  scattered  solar
    X-ray  background  observed  by ROSAT.    This program organizes the
    calculation of atmospheric column    densities  along  the  line  of
    sight  of  the  observation  and  the   intensity of scattered solar
    X-rays from those column densities   for pointed  observations.   It
    uses   the   subroutine  SSX  to  calculate    the  scattered  solar 
    spectrum.  It  also  calculates  the  count  rates    in  the  seven
    standard  pulse-height  bands.  The count rates are not   normalized
    but do tend to have  required  scale  factors  between  0.1  and  1.
      (The   actual    scale   factor  is  derived   using  the  program 
    RATE_FIT.)   AO  is written to use the  linear  combination  of  two
    thermal    spectra to model the solar spectrum.  The output of AO is
    used   by the program RATE_FIT to fit the observation light curve.
    
      AO creates a list of nominal scattered  solar  X-ray    background
    count  rates  on  the  60-s  sample  interval  of  the    orbit data
    extension of the RDF xxx_ANC.FITS   file.  The  output  is  used  in
    the  program  RATE_FIT    in  conjunction  with  the  output  of the
    program RATE to  fit  the  scattered    solar  X-ray  and  long-term
    enhancement background contamination.
    
    The input file:
    
    ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/caldb/data/gen/bcf/solar_geophys_data_v1.fits
    
    contains  solar  and  geophysical data which are required for AO and
    TILT.
    
    If the observation to be analyzed occurred after the range  of  time
    covered  by  the  file  (i.e.,  if  the  file  has  not been updated
    recently enough), AO will return a warning.
    
    The AO package uses the following input files.
    
    1)ancillary data fits file for  the  observation:  xxx_ANC.FITS  for
    RDF data
    2) Other fixed input :
    valid_times_all.dat  The file valid_times.dat is an ascii file; each
    line in the file consists of a  counter  (an  integer),  begin  time
    (an  integer),  and end time (an integer), where the times are given
    in terms of spacecraft clock time.   This  must  be  the  same  time
    selection  as  used  with  the programs CASTDATA, CASTEXP, CASTPART,
    and LTE.
    
    3) In addition, AO reads the following FITS  files  from  the  CALDB
    database:  On-axis  effective  area  (EFFAAREA), Window transmission
    (WTRANS), Gas efficiency (DET_EFF), ROSAT energy grid (ENERGY_GRID),
    Solar-geophys-data  file  (SOLAR_GEOPHYS),  Detector response matrix
    (MATRIX)   and   Raymond   and   Smith   thermal    spectra    (1991  
    vintage)(RAYMOND_SPECTRA).
    
    
    The output from the AO package are the following ASCII files.
    
    1)  AO_SSX_SC.OUT  - nominal SSX count rates on 60-s intervals, used
    in the program RATE_FIT.
    2) AO_COL.OUT - column densities of atmosphere constituents on  60-s
    intervals.
    
    
NOTES ON USAGE
    
    Before  running  this  task  user needs to set the CALDB environment
    variable in order to access  data  from  the  Calibration  Database.

PARAMETERS
    
    (obs = "OBS") [string]
        Observation identifier, which is the  prefix  for  the  filename
        xxxxxxxx_anc.fits.   Currently  obs  is limited to 8 characters,
        so   if   (for   example)   you   have   downloaded   the   file  
        rp900176n00_anc.fits  from  the ROSAT archive, you should rename
        it to rp900176_anc.fits before running AO.
    
    (iflag = "1") [integer]
        Mode  control:   IFLAG=1  for  simple  treatment,  2  for   more 
        complete  treatment.   The  simple  treatment  assumes  that the
        residual atmosphere of the observation geometry (both along  the
        line  of  sight and between the Sun and positions along the line
        of sight) is optically thin.  The more complete  treatment  uses
        a  nearly  complete  radiative  transfer  approach; it considers
        absorption between the Sun and a scattering  element  along  the
        line  of  sight  and  between  the  scattering  element  and the
        satellite.  The simple treatment runs  a  couple  of  orders  of
        magnitude  faster  and is probably sufficient for all ROSAT PSPC
        observations.
    
    (tlog1 = "6.2") [real]
        Temperature  for the  first  solar  component  -  the  intrinsic
        solar  X-ray  spectrum  is  modelled  as  two-component  thermal 
        plasma emission, in this case, Raymond  and  Smith  (1977)  with
        the  1991 computer code update.  The program requests the log_10
        of the temperature and the  scale  factor  for  each  component.
        These  same  temperatures  and  scale  factors must also be used
        below in the program TILT for consistency.
    
    (scale1 = "0.8") [real]
        The scale factor for the first solar component.
    
    (tlog2 = "5.7") [real]
        Temperature  for the second component - Scale factors which  sum
        to  one  for temperatures near log_10 T of near 6 (e.g., 6.2 0.8
        and 5.7 0.2) will give model count  rates  which  are  typically
        within  a  factor of a few to ten of the true values (determined
        later by the program RATE_FIT).
    
    (scale2 = "0.2") [real]
        The scale factor for the second solar component.
    
    (caldbdir = " ") [string]
        This should be left blank.  If the fixed input  FITS  files  are
        in  a different location than CALDB then the directory structure
        can  be  defined  using  caldbdir.   This  is  mostly  for  test 
        purposes and should be left unchanged.
    
    (calfexp = "caldb") [string]
        Name of calibration information to be used.
    
    (chatter = "9") [string]
        Chatter flag level for the output.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    
    1.  For  the input file test_anc.fits and for input parameters (6.2,
    0.8) and (5.7, 0.2) (as the first and second temperatures and  scale
    factors  respectively),  assuming  simple  treatment  (iflag=1)  the 
    usage is

BUGS
    The "OBS" parameter must  be  limited  to  8  characters.   Versions
    prior  to  FTOOLS 4.3 required that the input files be in uppercase;
    this   requirement    was    removed    in    FTOOLS    4.3.     The  
    solar_geophys_data_v1.fits only includes data up to 1995/09/30.
