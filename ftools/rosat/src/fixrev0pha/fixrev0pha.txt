FIXREV0PHA (Sep95)            ftools.rosat            FIXREV0PHA (Sep95)



NAME
    fixrev0pha  -  changes  the  CDELT1 and CDELT2 keywords in  a  ROSAT
    PHA file
    
    
    
USAGE
    fixrev0pha phafile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  tool  is  meant  to  be called primarily by Xselect.  The only
    other occasion for its  use  would  be  to  correct  spectral  files
    created  by  the extractor (or Xselect) from ROSAT/PSPC US Rev0 data
    before the release of FTOOLS 3.4.
    
    All versions of the extractor produce   WMAP  extensions   with  the
    wrong  CDELT  keywords when used on US Rev0 data. This can result in
    serious errors when using such tools as PCARF and  PCPARPHA.   These
    tools   will  warn  you if they see suspicious pixel sizes. RDF data
    or  German  data which  has  been  converted  with  GEVT2RDF  should
    NOT be processed with this tool.
    
    This   tool  will  check that the file is a ROSAT PSPC file and that
    it contains more than more than  2  keywords  beginning  with  'XS-'
    (arbitrarily  picked  for safety, it should contain 41 of them).  If
    so (i.e. US Rev0 data), it will replace the CDELT  keywords  in  the
    primary header so that the base pixel size is  2.595021E-4
    
    
    
    
    
WARNINGS ON USAGE
    
    You only have to run this tool once on any given file.
    
    
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    
    phafile [character string]
        An  extracted  spectrum  created  by  the  extractor (or Xselect
        which uses the extractor).
    
    (chatter = 10) [integer]
        Flag to indicate how chatty the task is at  execution.  A  value
        of  10  is the default. A value of zero means the tool will only
        report fatal errors.
    
    
    
EXAMPLES
    
    To fix a file named arlac.pha produced in xselect using  a  US  Rev0
    events file:
    
    >fixrev0pha arlac.pha

LOG OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
    
    
    v2.0.0 (1994 October)
            Made  it  a  compiled  program  so it would be guaranteed to
        work in absence of Perl under Xselect.
    
    v1.0.0 
            Perl version without screening for whether file was US  Rev0
        data.
