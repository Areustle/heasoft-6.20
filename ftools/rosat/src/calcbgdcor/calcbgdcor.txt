NAME
    calcbgdcor --> calculates the background spectra for a given  source
    region with a given background region, away from source region.

DESCRIPTION:
    
    The  usual  method  for  correcting  a  spectrum,  from  an  imaging 
    detector,  for background is to extract a spectrum from another part
    of the image and subtract  that  from  the  source  spectrum.   This
    assumes  that  the source region has the same background spectrum as
    the   background   region.    However,   in   practice,   instrument  
    performance  often varies across the face of the detector either due
    to mirror vignetting or changes in  detector  efficiency.   To  deal
    with  this  correction,  the  Xray  and  non-Xray part of background
    spectrum are separated.  Then corrections for  vignetting,  detector
    efficiency  and  the area scaling are applied to the Xray component.
    This is when added to the non-Xray component  of  the  source  gives
    the  background  spectra  for  the  source.   This is done using the
    results of the tasks PCPARPHA,  PCARF,  PCEXPMAP,  FIXREGION.   Now,
    CALCBGDCOR  collects  all  this information and returns the required
    corrected  background  spectra  for  the   chosen   source   region. 
    CALCBGDCOR  supports regions POINT,  CIRCLE, ELLIPSE,  ANNULUS,  and
    BOX.   It  does not  support POLYGON.
    
    
    
WARNINGS ON USAGE:
    
    Before  calling  CALCBGDCOR, one has to run FIXREGION to convert the
    region  files  (source   region   and   background  region)  to  the
    appropriate coordinate  system, i.e.  the coordinate  frame  of  the
    exposure map.  So, after running PCEXPMAP one has to run  FIXREGION,
    since CALCBGDCOR requires the corrected region files as inputs."
    
    Also, before running this task user needs to set  the  environmental
    variable   to   CALDB.   To   do  this,  one  needs  to  source  the 
    caldbinit.unix  or   caldbinit.vms   or   caldbinit_iraf.unix   file 
    depending on the system in use.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS:
    
    srcfil [character string]
        The name of the input FITS file containing the source spectrum.
    
    bckfil [character string]
        The  name  of  the  input  FITS  file  containing the background
        spectrum.
    
    arf_srcfil [character string]
        The name of the ARF file for the source.   This  is  the  output
        from PCARF.
    
    arf_bckfil [character string]
        The  name  of  the  ARF  file  for  the background.  This is the
        output from PCARF.
    
    particle_srcfil [character string]
        The name of the file containing source particle spectrum.   This
        is the output from PCPARPHA.
    
    particle_bckfil [character string]
        The  name  of  the file containing background particle spectrum.
        This is the output from PCPARPHA.
    
    rmffil  [character string]
        The name of the RMF file. By default, it is CALDB
    
    expmapfil [character string]
        The exposure map file.  This is the output from PCEXPMAP.
    
    regfil_sou [character string]
        The converted region file for source
    
    regfil_bck [character string]
        The converted region file for background
    
    outfil [character string]
        The output file name to contain the background spectra
    
    (chatter = 9) [integer]
        Flag to set the chattyness at execution.  Default value  is  set
        to  9,  which  gives the user the task version and few warnings.
        Lower/higher  values  produces  quieter/verbose  output  on  the 
        screen.
    
    (clobber = false) [boolean]
        Flag  specifying  whether  or  not  a pre-existing file with the
        same name as that  requested as the output file from  this  task
        will be overwritten.
