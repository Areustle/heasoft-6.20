NAME
    pcfilt -- creates a ROSAT PSPC makefilter file dataset
    
    
USAGE
    pcfilt infile outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
      This  task  creates  a  ROSAT  PSPC  makefilter  file. The task is
    essentially an FTOOLized version of Steve  Snowden's  GEOMETRY  code
    and  provides  data  similar  to  the TREND data files, except on an
    observation rather than ROSAT day basis.  PCFILT sorts  through  the
    orbit,  attitude,  event  rate,  status,  and  housekeeping  data to
    produce a time-ordered list of diagnostic information which  can  be
    used  to  screen  data.   Examples are the master veto count rate or
    observation zenith angle.

PARAMETERS
    
    infile [character string]
         The name of the RDF format ancillary FITS file.
    
    outfile [character string]
         The name of the output file.
    
    (chatter=9) [Integer]
         Flag to indicate how chatty the task is at execution.  A  value
        of  9  is  the   default,  with  lower/higher  values  producing
