NAME
    gevt2rdf -- Converts a German _events dataset to RDF _bas format.
    
    
    
USAGE
    gevt2rdf evtfile revtfile outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
    This  task  takes  as  input a German events file and (optionally) a
    German difevents file and writes a file which obeys the  RDF  format
    for  keywords,  etc.  This  should  allow  use of most ftools on old
    German data.  The resulting _bas style file will  only  contain  the
    first  three  extensions  of an actual RDF _bas file (two extensions
    if a difevents file is not given).
    
    
    
    
WARNINGS ON USAGE
    
    Please report any comments/problems or bugs  to  Lawrence  E.  Brown
    (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/ftoolshelp).
    
    
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    
    evtfile [character string]
        The   German  _events  file  containing  the  Standard  Accepted 
        Events. (Extension numbers will be ignored)
    
    revtfile [character string]
        The rejected  events  file  name  (i.e.  the  _difevents  file).
        Specifying   a   '-'   will   look  for   a  file  of  the  form 
        *_difevents.* where the *'s indicate the corresponding parts  of
        the  evtfile  parameter (construed as *_events.*).  If reject is
        set to false (see below) this parameter will not  be  used  (but
        must  be  present  on the command line for the current parameter
        interface to remain happy).
    
    outfile [character string]
        The output file name.  Specifying a '-' will create a file named
        *_bas.fits  where  *  indicates  the  corresponding  part of the
        events file  name.  A  !  as  the  first  character  will  force
        overwriting  an  existing  output  file.   A '!-' does just what
        you'd expect.
    
    (reject = yes) [logical]
        If true, the program will include a  Rejected  Events  extension
        created from the file specified in the revtfile parameter.
    
    (irafprefix = '-') [character string]
        The  PROS  names  imbedded  in  the  keywords of the output file
        (*.qp, *_stdgti.tab, and *_rejevt.tab).   A  '-'  will  instruct
        the  program  to construct something appropriate from the events
        file name.
    
    (chatter = 10) [integer]
         Flag to indicate how chatty the task is at execution.  A  value
        of  10  is  the   default,  with  lower/higher  values producing
        quieter/verbose output  respectively.
    
    (clobber = no) [logical]
        Overwrite existing output file by default if true.
    
    
    
EXAMPLES
    
    To make  an  RDF  type  file  wp141923n00_bas.fits  from  the  files
    wp141923n00_events.tfits and wp141923n00_difevents.tfits:
    
    >gevt2rdf wp141923n00_events.tfits - -
    
    To   make   an   RDF   type  file  test.fits  from  the  input  file 
    test_events.fits with no Rejected Events extension:
    
    >gevt2rdf test_events.fits - test.fits reject=no
