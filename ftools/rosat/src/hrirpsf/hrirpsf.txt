DESCRIPTION
    
      hrirpsf  generates  a  theoretical  radial  (1-dimensional)  point 
    spread  function  dataset  for the ROSAT HRI, and writes the results
    to an output FITS file (in OGIP-standard format for RPSFs).  Details
    of  the  o/p  file  formats  supported  can  be  found  in  the OGIP
    Calibration           Memo            CAL/GEN/92-020;            see          
    http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/caldb/docs/summary/cal_gen_92_020_summary.html
    
      A  number  of  options  are available, controlled via user-defined
    parameters, such that the task hopefully serves the needs  of  users
    interested  in  generating  predicted profiles for direct comparison
    with observations,  and  users  who  simply  require  a  theoretical
    profile.  Besides being able to specify the inner & outer radii, and
    number  of  steps  used  to  calculate  the  theoretical  RPSF,  the 
    following functionality is also available:
    
    Users may define an input FITS file (via the parameter infile) containing 
        an  observed  radial  profile dataset (in OGIP-standard format).
        If such  a  dataset  is  entered  then  a  number  of  variables
        required  for  the  construction of the theoretical RPSF dataset
        are (or can be) read from this FITS extension such as to  enable
        a   direct  comparison  between  the  observed  and  theoretical 
        profiles (see below).
    
    The PSF of the ROSAT HRI is a function of off-axis angle, hence the off-axis
        angle is required in order to calculate the correct  theoretical
        curve.  A  'wobble'  of  the  spacecraft  was performed for most
        'pointed' HRI observations, and an off-axis histogram is  stored
        within  the 'DETECTOR' extension of PHA files conforming to OGIP
        standards for the HRI. Such a histogram can be  specified  using
        the  detfil parameter within hrirpsf. If such a histogram is not
        available/required, an off-axis angle can be specified  directly
        via the parameter off_ang.
    
    Users may specify the intensity of the background (via the parameter
        bkgd;  in  units  of  counts per pixel) which will be scaled and
        added appropriately to the theoretical profile generated.  If  a
        dataset  has  been  entered  via  the parameter infile, then the
        specification of the bkgd  parameter  will  override  the  value
        stored  within the dataset. In addition, if a dataset is entered
        as INFILE then users may ask for a bkgd value to be calculated.
    
    The algorithm in use was supplied by Larry David (CfA) in 1993  Nov.
    THIS  IS  ONLY  A  CRUDE  ESTIMATE of the actual radial point spread
    function.  Variations in the quality of  the  aspect  solution  will
    affect  the derived PSF for real data.  It is therefore advised that
    the use of this model be  limited  to  performing  relatively  crude
    tests   as  to  whether  a  source  is  extended  and/or  performing 
    corrections to count rates derived  from  extraction  cells  smaller
    than  the  PSF.   It  is NOT recommended that this model be used for
    detailed deconvolution of extended sources.
    
    
    
WARNINGS ON USAGE
    
      Only the  OGIP-recognized  format  for  RPSF.   Details  on  these
    formats can be found in:
    
    RPSFs:  OGIP Calibration Memo CAL/GEN/92-020
    
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [character string]
         An  input  filename  (in  OGIP-standard  format)  containing  a 
        1-dimensional  radial profile of  a  source,  or  'NONE'.  If  a
        filename  is  to  be  entered,  then a specific extension of the
        input file containing the observational  dataset to be  operated
        on  can  be specified by including the integer extension  number
        in square ("["extn#"]") brackets after the filename. If  such  a
         specification  is  not  used,  then  the  entire  file  will be
        searched for  extensions likely to contain an RPSF  dataset.  In
        such  cases, if the input  file is then found to consist of more
        than one acceptable dataset, the  task will warn  the  user  and
        stop.  If  a  single  acceptable  extension  is   found, then by
        default the following  information  required  to  generate   the
        theoretical profile will be read from it:
    
    the level of the background (can be overridden using the bkgd 
         parameter to this task)
    
    the pixel size of the original image used to construct the 
         observational dataset
    
    The total number of SOURCE counts required to lay under the predicted
         RPSF  curve.  This  value  is recalculated if the bkgd value is
        changed.
    
    detfil [character string]
         An input file containing an off-axis histogram to be  used  for
        weighting  the   theoretical  radial  profile,  or 'NONE'.Such a
        histogram can be written to   a  file  if  the  PHA  dataset  is
        converted     to    an    OGIP    format    using    the    task   
         ftools/caltools/stw2pha
    
    outfile [character string]
         The name of the output file to be  created  (in  OGIP  standard
        format)   containing  an  extension  with  the  predicted radial
        profile model. If an  observational dataset is entered (via  the
        infile  parameter),  then  this   dataset  will be copied into a
        seperate extension of the output file.
    
    (chatter) [integer (hidden)]
         The value  of  the  chatter  flag,  useful  for  reassurance  &
        diagostics   purposes.  The  default  value  is  chatter=9, with
        chatter <= 5 being very  quite and chatter >= 20 very verbose.
    
    bkgd [character string (real value parsed)]
         Background level, in counts per pixel (assumed  to  be  uniform
        over  the  extent of the profile),which will be scaled and added
        appropriately to the  theoretical profile  generated.  In  cases
        where  an  observational  dataset  has   been specified (via the
        infile  parameter),  the  bkgd  parameter   enables   users   to 
         'override'   the   background  level  stored  in  this  file;by 
        entering a new  background value or by using the  special  value
        "CALC"  which  results  in a  background value being calculated.
        NOTE: If a new bkgd value is used then  the sum  of  the  counts
        used  to lay under the predicted RPSF is recalculated.   If this
        is not desired, then the special (default)  value  of  "%"  will
        result   in  using  the background from the dataset specified by
        INFILE. In cases where  INFILE=NONE, a numerical value  of  bkgd
        must  be specified (but this value can  be 0.0). If INFILE=NONE,
        the user must specify the angular size  of  a   pixel  (via  the
        pixsize  parameter), and the total number of source counts  (via
        the sumtcts parameter) to which the RPSF is to be normalised.
    
    bkgd_rad [real]
         Only prompted for if bkgd="CALC". This is the inner radius  for
        background   calculation.  NOTE:  For  ROSAT  HRI  data an inner
        radius  less  than  1/2  arcmin   is  not  recommended  as   the 
        background estimate could be contaminated by  the PSF.
    
    sumtcts [real]
         The  total  number  of  SOURCE counts required to lay under the
        predicted RPSF  curve (when this  curve  is  integrated  out  to
        infinite   radius,   and   over  all   azimuthal  angles).  This 
        parameter is only required when  no  observational   dataset  is
        entered (ie when INFILE=NONE).
    
    pix_size [real]
         The  angular  size  of  the  side  of  each  square  pixel  (in 
        arcmins).  This  parameter is  only  required  when  infile=NONE
        and the value of the  background parameter is not equal to zero.
    
    (rad_min) [integer (hidden)]
         Inner  radius  for  the predicted model RPSF dataset in arcmin.
        The default  value is 0.0 and appropriate for most applications.
    
    (rad_max) [integer (hidden)]
         Outer radius for the predicted model RPSF  dataset  in  arcmin.
        The   default    value   is   10.0   and  appropriate  for  most 
        applications.
    
    (n_rad) [integer (hidden)]
         The number of radial bins to be used  in  generating  the  RPSF
        dataset.  The  default value is 300. For most applications it is
        suggested that this be  a large number (at least 100)  in  order
        to  obtain  sufficient  resolution  to see  the structure of the
        theoretical RPSF of the HRI. The number of bins does   NOT  have
        to  be  the  same  as  the  number  of bins in any observational
        dataset  entered via infile.
    
    off_ang [real]
         The off-axis angle (in arcmin) for  which  the  predicted  PRSF
        dataset  is  to  be   generated. This parameter is only required
        (and prompted for) if an off-axis  dataset has NOT been  entered
        via  the  detfil parameter. The current  parameterization of the
        HRI profile is only valid out to approximately 28  arcmins  from
        the  optical  axis,  thus  angles  outside  this  range  will be
        ignored.
    
    (clobber) [boolean (hidden)]
         Flag specifying whether or not a  pre-existing  file  with  the
        same  name  as that  requested as the output file from this task
        will be overwritten.  Default  value is no.
