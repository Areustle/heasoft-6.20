c
      program abc

c Apply Barycentric Corrections to event data.

c For ROSAT only.

c This program corrects the times in a file -- both the entries in the
c TIME column of an event list and the Good Time intervals in a
c separate extension, as well as their header timing keywords -- for
c the ROSAT spacecraft clock and for the time delay given in a
c specified correction table.  The original file is NOT overwritten.  It
c is copied to a new file and the relevant entries are corrected in place.

c See subroutine abcmake for a detailed description of the algorithm.

      subroutine abcmake(in_fil,bc_fil,ou_fil,rastr,decstr,scc_fil,ierr)

c MAKE timing corrections for program ABC.

c This routine opens 4 FITS files:
c    an input data file (lui);
c    a barycenter correction table (lub);
c    an output file (luo);
c    and a spacecraft clock correction file (luc)
c The output file is a straight copy of the input file, with all TIME
c values -- EVENT data, GTI's and timing keywords -- corrected to the solar
c system barycenter (or actually to whatever correction is given by the
c corretion table).

c Several preliminary checks are made in this routine:

c    the input file should have the keyword TIMEREF = 'LOCAL';

c    the RA and  DEC in the correction file should agree with values
c    input by the user;

c    Times in the data file should be contained within start and stop of
c    the correction table;

c    The correction table should be contained in extensions that have the
c    keyword EXTAME = 'TIMEREF'.

c    The routine looks for the MJDREF keyword based on US ROSAT old and
c    new-type formats (either the pair XS-MJDRD, XS-MJDRF or MJDREFI,
c    MJDREFF respectively).  If this is not found the program exits.
c    The MJD reference value is used to convert times internally to
c    compare with the correction table, which is listed in JD.  The
c    corrected times are written to the output file in the original time
c    system.

c Several keywords are modified in the output file:

c    TIMEREF = 'SOLARSYSTEM'
c    CLOCKAPP = T
c    TIMESYS is constructed by concatenating the ZEROTIME and ZERODATE
c       keywords from input file.  If the ZEROTIME and ZERODATE
c       keywords are not found TIMESYS is deleted.
c    TASSIGN is deleted.
c    TSTART, TSTOP, TIMEZERO and TIMEUNIT are updated.

c The routine then gathers information about the structure of event list
c and enters a loop for the correction.  It reads each time from the file,
c correct for spacecraft clock (subroutine scc2utc), subtracts off the
c MJD reference value and gets the corrected time from subroutine abcgcor.
c It keeps track of any photons that arrived in gaps of greater than
c 2 minutes in the barycenter correction table and records them in the
c extension header.  At the end of the loop the number of gap photons
c is recorded in the priamry header and a warning is issued if there were
c any.

c    The routine assumes the input times are listed in their spacecraft
c    clock values (in seconds).  They
c    are written to the new file in seconds from the MJD reference value.

c The routine then does the same for the GTI extension, keeping track of
c the earliest corrected GTI start and the latest corrected GTI stop.
c These are then used as the TSTART and TSTOP keyword values in both
c extension headers.

c  I  in_fil    (c)  Name of input file
c  I  bc_fil    (c)  Name of barycenter correction file
c  I  ou_fil    (c)  name of output file
c  I  rastr     (c)  R.A. string
c  I  decstr    (c)  Declination string
c  I  scc_fil   (c)  Name of SCC correction file
c  I  ierr      (i)  Error status

----------------------

      subroutine abcgcor(lub,extmax,bcext,timuncor,dtoffset,outside
     &                  ,timcor,ierr)

c Get a barycentrically CORrect time for program ABC.

c This routine makes an interpolation on the barycenter correction table
c that closely parallels the algorithm used in IRAF/PROS.

c On the first call the routine loads all rows from all extensions in the
c table into memory.  The current limit to the number of rows is 10000.

c >>> This routine should be rewritten to have a location in dynamic memory
c     passed to it, with the vectors hcor and huncor passed as dummy
c     arguments.  <<<

c On all calls, the routine makes a linear interpolation on the barycenter
c table.  Normally, ROSAT orbit files have their rows spaced 1 minute
c apart.  If an input time falls in a space between successive rows
c in the table that are more than 2 miniues apart, or if the time falls
c completely outside the range of the table, the logical variable outside is
c returned .true.

c The routine assumes the table is written in four column format, with
c the uncorrected time in JD -- Integer part in column 1 and
c fractional part in column 2; and the full corrected time in columns 3 and 4.

c  I  lub      (i)  Lu of correction table file.
c  I  extmax   (i)  Dimension of bcext
c  I  bcext    (i)  Array of FITS extension numbers for TIMEREF extensions
c  I  timuncor (d)  Input uncorrected time in JD - dtoffset
c  I  dtoffset (d)  Internal offset to retain maximum accuracy
c  O  outside  (l)  = .true. of input time fell in a gap in the table.
c  O  timcor   (d)  Output corrected time in JD - dtoffset
c  O  ierr     (i)  error status
