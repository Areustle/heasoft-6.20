NAME
    pcecor -- Corrects PI channel in Events file
    
    
USAGE
    pcecor infile outfile alkfile calflag
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
    This tool operates on  Rev0, or RDF PSPC events file. The tool  also
    operates  on  any  German   PSPC events file converted to RDF format
    using the 'gevt2rdf' ftool.
    
    pcecor uses calibration data from the PANTER facility in Neuried  to
    correct  for  the  variation  in  the linearity of the PSPC response
    with absolute gain.  The data were  collected  several  years  after
    the  launch  of  ROSAT  using  the  engineering  model PSPC.  It was
    observed that the effective gain in the 0.25 - 1.0 keV energy  range
    was  lower  than  expected  after normalizing to the 1.5 keV monitor
    line, and this effect became worse with lower  absolute  gain.   For
    example,  a  0.75  keV  X-ray  might be detected as a 0.72 keV X-ray
    when the PSPC was operating at low gain.  Data  from  higher  energy
    calibration  lines  were collected at the same time, which allowed a
    check of response linearity over an  extended  energy  range.   Note
    that this correction was never implemented in SASS.
    
    NOTE:  A   bug  in  the  PCECOR  ftool  has  resulted in too small a
    correction being applied to the PI channel.  This bug has  now  been
    fixed  and  the alternative correction algorithm, based on Prieto et
    al. (1996, A&A Suppl., 120, 187), has also  been  incorporated  into
    the tool.
    
    In  the  new  version,  users can choose from one of two options for
    the PI correction: 1) Using calibration  data  from  the  PANTER  2)
    Using  in-flight   observations  of  calibration  sources  (such  as 
    N132D) to determine the PI correction as a  function  of  time.  See
    Prieto, Hasinger and Snowden (1996) for details.
    
    
    THE CALIBRATION FILES REQUIRED FOR THE TASK
    
    The  default  setting  for  the  input calibration files is 'CALDB',
    this  facility  can  only  be  used  by  beta-test  sites   of   the 
    calibration  database  access  software.  Most  users  will  need to
    obtain  a  set  of  calibration  files  via   anonymous   ftp   from 
    heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov. The datasets are located in the directory:
    
             ftp://legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov/caldb/data/rosat/pspc/bcf/alk_gainmaps
    
    
    
SUPPORTED FITS FILE FORMATS
    
       Currently  only  the  following  OGIP  standards are supported by
    this task
    
    
    For the input events file :
    
    RDF EXTNAME = 'STDEVT'
    
    US REV0 EXTNAME='EVENTS'  
    
    HDUCLAS1='EVENTS'
    
    HDUCLAS2='ACCEPTED'
    
    
    For the Calibration files :
    
    For further details see OGIP calibration memo CAL/ROS/95-010
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [character string]
        The name of the Events file.
    
    (gtifile) [character string]
        The name of the GTI file.  Defaults to the name  of  the  Events
        file (infile).
    
    outfile [character string]
        The name of the output file.
    
    alkfile [character string]
        The names of the alk gainmaps.
    
    calflag [integer]
        Flag  to  indicate  which  callibration  to  use. For calflag=1,
        ground callibration file is used and for calflag other  than  1,
        in-flight callibration file used.
    
    (chatter=9) [Integer]
        Flag  to  indicate  how chatty the task is at execution. A value
        of  9  is  the  default,  with  lower/higher  values   producing 
        quieter/verbose output respectively.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        Overwrite output file, if it already exists ?
    
    
    
EXAMPLE
    Note  that  this  example  assumes  that  the  user has CALDB access
    properly configured.  The easiest way to do this is  to  access  the
    CALDB    at    the    HEASARC    over    the    internet    -    see
