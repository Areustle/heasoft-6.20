NAME
    src2pha  --  Creates  a PHA file from specified extensions in an RDF
    src file
    
    
USAGE
    src2pha infile outfile specext oahext
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
    Input is a ROSAT RDF *_src.fits file from a PSPC observation) and  a
    choice  of  spectral  and  OAH  extension  numbers.  Output is a PHA
    (spectral) file in the standard form  for  use  with  Xspec,  pcarf,
    etc.
    
    NOTE:  It  is  recommended  that you use the EXTPHA driver script to
    call this ftool. Just type 'extpha' at your UNIX prompt  and  follow
    the instructions.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The input source file.
    
    outfile [file name]
        The output PHA file.
    
    specext [integer]
        The  extension  number  for  the  extension  containing spectral
        information. (Primary HDU is the 0th extension.)
    
    oahext [integer]
        The extension number for the extension containing the  off  axis
        histogram   information.   This   will  almost  certainly  be  = 
        specext+1.  (Primary HDU is the 0th extension.)
    
    (chatter = 10) [integer]
        How much do you want to know.  (0 dead silent: only fatal errors
        reported, 5 quiet,10 normal,15 high,>20 silly)
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        Whether to overwrite an existing output file.
    
    
EXAMPLES 
    To  extract a file wibble.pha from the 7th and 8th extensions of the
    wibble_src.fits file:
    
    ft>src2pha wibble_src.fits wibble.pha 7 8
