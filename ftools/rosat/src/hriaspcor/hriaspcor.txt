NAME
    hriaspcor -- Use Morse's method to correct aspect  errors  in  large
    photon event lists from HRI.
    
    
USAGE
    hriaspcor infile outfile iwobbin mincnts
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Reads  an  HRI  events  list  and uses the algorithm of Jon Morse to
    correct the standard aspect solution  for  detector  "wobble".   See
    (Morse,  PASP  1994)  for  details  of  the algorithm.  Writes a new
    events  list  with  corrected  values  of  X  and  Y   (actual   sky 
    position).   If  the  copyall parameter is set to true, the new file
    should be identical to the old one except for the X  and  Y  columns
    in  the "good" events table and the necessary keyword changes in the
    headers. Default values  of  the  parameters  assume  an  RDF  file.
    Previously  released  data  sets use FITS extension [3] and detector
    coordinate column names DX and  DY.   It  is  recommended  that  the
    "dewobbling"  bin  size  should  correspond to ~10", and the mincnts
    parameter should not be less than 100.  Note,  this  technique  will
    fail  for  extended  sources  (i.e. anything with a real size larger
    than the "dewobbling" bin size.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename]
        The input FITS file name and extension.
    
    outfil [filename]
        The output FITS file name.  The new table will be  in  the  same
        extension  as it was in infile. (Unless copyall=no, then it will
        be in extension 1.)
    
    iwobbin [integer]
        The  binning  size   for   taking   centroids   and   restacking 
        ("dewobbling").  Recomended size: approximately 10", or about 20
        pixels.
    
    mincnts [real]
        Minimum  number  of  counts  in  a   valid   "dewobbling"   bin. 
        Recommended: at least 100.
    
    (xcol = 'RAWX') [string]
        The name of the column containing the detector X coordinates.
    
    (ycol = 'RAWY') [string]
        The name of the column containing the detector Y coordinates.
    
    (xcolcor = 'X') [string]
        The name of the column containing the X sky coordinates.
    
    (ycolcor = 'Y') [string]
        The name of the column containing the Y sky coordinates.
    
    (xrange = 'INDEF,INDEF') [string]
        The  X  range of valid pixels in detector coordinates (note: not
        sky coordinates).
    
    (yrange = 'INDEF,INDEF') [string]
        The Y range of valid pixels in detector coordinates  (note:  not
        sky coordinates).
    
    (copyprime=yes) [boolean]
        Whether  to  copy all additional keywords from the primary array
        of input file to the primary array of the output file.
    
    (copyall=yes) [boolean]
        Whether to copy all other  HDUs  from  the  input  file  to  the
        output file.
    
    (clobber=no) [boolean]
        Whether to overwrite an existing output file.
    
    
EXAMPLES 
    To    make    a    Morse-corrected    version   of   an   RFD   file  
    rh141873n00_bas.fits
    
    ft>hriaspcor rh141873n00_bas.fits rh141873n00_bas_m.fits 20 100
    
    To make a Morse-corrected table of the events  from  an  old  format
    (US  Rev0) HRI file rh160093.fits and write it as the only extension
    in a file called meaty.fits
    
    ft>hriaspcor   rh160093.fits[3]   meaty.fits   20   100   copyall=no  
    xcol="DX" ycol="DY"
    
    
    
NOTES:
    If  more  than  one  bright source is in the field, you must use the
    xrange and yrange parameters to isolate the source of interest.
    
    
    
KNOWN BUGS
    
    Does not treat each orbit separately as specified in Morse's paper.
    
    Subimage centroids are calculated by finding the center  of  gravity
    of  the entire subimage rather than just the central 3" (i.e. unlike
    in Morse, no radial brightness profiles are calculated).
    
    
    
LOG OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES
    
    
    v1.1 (1994 Sept.)

        ftools standard and added some new documentation.
    
    v1.0.0 (1994 July)
        Original version.
