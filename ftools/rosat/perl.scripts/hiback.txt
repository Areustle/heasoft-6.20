                              hiback 1.0.0

This script calculates the average background for an HRI _bas file, creates a
_qsrc file (by running mkqsrc on an _src file), and  writes a BKG_SUSP
keyword to the qsrc file.  You may specify the _bas file by putting
bas=bas_file_name on the command line. If you don't specify a file on the
command line, you will be prompted. The script will look for  an _src file
based on the *name* of the _bas file. If it can't find one,  the script will
ask for one; this may be overridden by specifying  src=src_file_name on the
command line. BKG_SUSP is true if the average background is > 8x10^-7
cts/pix/sec. If you specify '-v' on the command line, hiback will print out a
histogram showing the time at each level.  1 is low, 14 or so is high. Units
are cts/sec/pixel.  Sample output for:
