NAME
    mk_allevt -- combines the standard and rejected events tables of  an
    RDF file
    
    
    
USAGE
    mk_allevt
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
    
    This  script will combine the accepted and rejected events tables in
    an RDF basic file (*_bas.fits) to  make  an  all  events  table  and
    figure  out  a corresponding  GTI table using the RDF ancillary file
    (*_anc.fits). You may want to name your output  with  the  extension
    _abas.fits.
    
    You may specify the input and output files on the command line:
    
    >mk_allevt xxx_bas.fits xxx_anc.fits xxx_abas.fits
    
    
    You can also say:
    
    >mk_allevt xxx_bas%
    
    to  specify  the default extensions (i.e. xxx_bas.fits, xxx_anc.fits
    and xxx_abas.fits). A ! preceeding the output  filename  will  force
    overwriting  as  usual.   (Remember to use  \!  if you are typing on
    the command line). The program will prompt you for filenames if  any
    are missing or confusing. So you can also just type:
    
    >mk_allevt
    
    and  answer the questions.  This is actually the preferred method of
    running the script.
    
    
    
FLAGS
    
    -v   Verbose mode.  Prints informative messages and the output  from
    some ftools calls.
    
    -(no)sort    Requires  (supresses)  sorting  of  the  output  events 
    extension by photon arrival time.
    
    -h  Prints help message.

    Note: This is a perl script which runs the FTOOLS: MAKETIME, FMERGE,
    FEXTRACT,  FAPPEND  and  various FUTIL routines.  You must have perl
    installed at your site to run this.
