The program TWOPAR can be used to make an XSPEC table model from a series
of spectra produced from a model with two changing parameters.

You should edit the file specread2.f to read in the spectra and other
info required. The file test.mod included in this directory was created
using the distributed version of specread2.

To build twopar you will need HEAsoft installed with the $HEADAS variable
defined (as it should be by the standard set-up). Just type make in the
current directory and the onepar executable will be created. If you get a
warning about being unable to find a xanlib and/or cfitsio library you 
will need to edit the Makefile to use the version(s) you find in $HEADAS/lib.

Please send any questions, problems, or suggestions to
