The program ONEPAR can be used to make an XSPEC table model from a series
of spectra produced from a model with a single changing parameter.

You should edit the file specread.f to read in the spectra and other
info required. The file test.mod included in this directory was created
using the distributed version of specread.

To build onepar you will need HEAsoft installed with the $HEASOFT variable
defined (as it should be by the standard set-up). Just type hmake in the
current directory and the onepar executable will be created.

Please send any questions, problems, or suggestions to
