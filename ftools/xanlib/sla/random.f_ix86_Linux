*  !!!  Version for Linux !!!
*
*  Given:
*     SEED     real     an arbitrary real number
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1)  The result is a pseudo-random REAL number in the range
*      0 <= sla_RANDOM < 1.
*
*  2)  SEED is used first time through only.
*
*  Called:  RANDOM (a REAL function compiled by the makefile from rtl_random.c)
