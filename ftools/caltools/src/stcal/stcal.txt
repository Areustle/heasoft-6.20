NAME
    stcal -- Stores one or more calibration files in the Caldb
    
    
USAGE
    stcal files
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task will open each calibration file  specified  by  the  files
    parameter  and  search  for  the  keywords  TELESCOP,  INSTRUME  and 
    CCLS0001. When all three  keywords are found, the  caldbconfig  file
    is  consulted  to  determine  the directory to which the calibration
    file should be moved. If the CCLS0001 keyword value  is  "BCF"  then
    the  calibration  file  will be moved to the "bcf" storage directory
    of the directory specified in the caldbconfig file. If the  CCLS0001
    keyword  value  is  "CPF" then the calibration file will be moved to
    the "cpf" storage directory.
