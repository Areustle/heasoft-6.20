NAME
    dmprmf -- Displays OGIP standard Response FITS file
    
    
USAGE
     infile dispebd disprmf disphd dipsmat outfile ebdchan rmfener
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
       DMPRMF displays  the  contents  of  an  OGIP  standard  RMF  file
    (containing  the  detector response matrix) to the terminal or to an
    ASCII file, if the user enters an output filename. The  EBOUNDS  and
    RMF  extensions can be displayed with user-defined channel or energy
    ranges respectively. In addition the response matrix can be  written
    as an image in FITS format, if the user enters an image filename.
    
    
    
SUPPORTED FITS FILE FORMATS
    
       Currently  only  the  following  OGIP  standards are supported by
    this task
    
    For the RSP_MATRIX extension:
        HDUCLAS1/HDUVERS1= 'RESPONSE'/'1.0.0'
        
        HDUCLAS2/HDUVERS2= 'RSP_MATRIX'/'1.1.0'
                (commonly also known as "RMFVERSN=1992a")
    
    For the EBOUNDS extension:
        HDUCLAS1/HDUVERS1= 'RESPONSE'/'1.0.0'
        
        HDUCLAS2/HDUVERS2= 'EBOUNDS'/'1.1.0'
    
    For further details see OGIP Calibration Memo CAL/GEN/92-002a.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [character string]
         The input filename containing the RMF data  in  OGIP  standard,
        as a BINARY table extension
    
    ebdfile (%) [character string]
         The  EBOUNDS  filename,  the  default  "%"  indicates  that the
        EBOUNDS is in the same file as the RMF data. This  is  a  hidden
        parameter
    
    dispebd [boolean]
         The default is "Y", the EBOUNDS data is displayed
    
    disprmf [boolean]
         The default is "Y", the RMF data is displayed
    
    disphd [boolean]
         The default is "N",only the mandatory keywords are displayed
    
    primary (primary="N") [boolean]
         The  default  is  "N",  the  primary  header of RMF file is not
        displayed.  This is a hidden parameter
    
    dispmat [boolean]
         The default is "Y", the full matrix is displayed
    
    outfile [character string]
         The name of the output file to be  written  to.  If  no  output
        file is entered then there is a screen display
     .ls  chatter  (chatter=9) [integer]  The value of the chatter flag,
    useful for reassurance & diagostics  purposes. The default value  is
    chatter=9,  with  chatter  <=  5 being very  quiet and chatter >= 20
    very verbose. This is a hidden parameter
    
    ebdchan [integer]
         Ebounds channel display range
    
    rmfener [integer]
         Energy display range
    
    imagefile (imagefile=" ") [character string]
         This is a hidden parameter, to define an output image  filename
        if  desired.   The  default  is no image filename. This image is
        for display purposes only.  It should be noted that  the  energy
        bins along the y-axis can be variable.
    
    page (page="yes")  [boolean] 
         Default  is  "yes",  screen display is paged . This is a hidden
        parameter
    
    more [boolean]
         Default is "yes", continue display
    
    (clobber = false) [boolean]
         Flag specifying whether or not a  pre-existing  file  with  the
        same  name  as that  requested as the output file from this task
        will be overwritten.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1. To display "my_file.rmf" , showing the EBOUNDS data with  channel
       range  10-20,  the  RMF  data  with  energy  range  234-256,  and 
    displaying    only the mandatory header :
    
    ca> dmprmf my_file.rmf ebdchan=10-20 rmfener=234-256
