NAME
    mkcaldir -- Create the Caldb directory structure
    
    
USAGE
    mkcaldir
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  creates  "bcf"  and "cpf" storage subdirectories beneath
    each  directory   specified   in   the   caldbconfig   file.   These 
    subdirectories  store  "Basic  Calibration  Files"  and "Calibration
    Product Files", respectively. If  the  directory  specified  in  the
    caldbconfig  file  does  not  exist, it will be created. Optionally,
    empty  Calibration Index Files also  specified  in  the  caldbconfig
    file can be created by this task.
    
    The  path  to  the caldbconfig file is obtained from the CALDBCONFIG
    environment variable or logical.  The user may also need to set  the
    CALDB  environment  variable  or logical before executing this task.
    See the Caldb help page and Caldb User's Guide for more  information
    on how to set these system variables.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    (chatter = 9) [integer]
        Flag  to  indicate  how chatty the task is at execution. A value
        of  9  is  the  default,  with  lower/higher  values   producing 
        quieter/verbose  output  respectively.   A  value  of  chatter=0 
        gives totally  silent  running,  with  the  exception  of  error
        messages.
    
    (mkcifs=yes) [boolean]
        Toggles  whether  or  not  empty  Calibration  Index  Files  are 
        created.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.  Create a Caldb directory structure along with empty  Calibration
    Index  Files  and  print informational messages about what this task
    is doing.
