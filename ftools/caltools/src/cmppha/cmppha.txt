NAME
    cmppha -- Converts a TYPE II to a TYPE I OGIP pha file
    
    
USAGE
    cmppha infile outfile cmpmode
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
      This  task  converts an OGIP standard TYPE II pha file to a TYPE I
    pha file. A TYPE II pha file contains  one  extension  with  one  or
    more  spectra  stored  as  rows. A TYPE I pha file contains only one
    spectrum in an extension. This  task  has  two  modes,  Squish,  and
    Expand.  Squish compresses (adds) all the TYPE I spectra to form one
    spectrum, and writes  it  to  the  output  file.  Expand  writes  an
    extension  for  each spectrum.    The resultant output file can then
    be used by other ftools (eg GRPPHA) that expect a TYPE  I  pha  file
    as input.
    
    
    
SUPPORTED FITS FORMATS
    
      Currently  only the following OGIP standards are supported by this
    task:
    
    HDUCLAS1/HDUVERS1 = 'SPECTRUM'/'1.*.*'
            (commonly also known as "PHAVERSN=1992a")
    
    HDUCLAS2 = 'TOTAL'/'NET'/'BKG'
    
    HDUCLAS3 = 'COUNT'/'RATE'
    
    HDUCLAS4 = 'TYPE:II'
    
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [character string]
         The name of the FITS PHA file to be compressed or expanded.
    
    outfile [character string]
         The name of the FITS file to  be  written  containing  the  PHA
        dataset(s)
    
    cmpmode [character string]
         The  conversion  mode  to  be  used.  Squish  or Expand are the
        options. Squish  will  compress  all  the  pha  spectra  in  one
        extension  of  a  TYPE  II  pha  file, into one spectrum. Expand
        writes a seperate extension for each spectrum.
    
    (rows="-") [character string]
         The range of rows to squish/expand. The default of - means operate 
         on all rows.  The first ten rows could be specified as ROWS=1-10, 
         or just ROWS=-10.  To operate on the first three rows and all rows 
         from 11, use ROWS=1-3,11-.  ROWS=3,5,7 will select only these three 
         rows.

    (datacol=" ") [character string]
         The column name to read in the input file. By default (" "), cmppha
         will use either COUNTS or RATE column, as specified in the Type II 
         PHA file standard.  This hidden parameter can be used to force it to 
         operate on an additional column that is present in the input file 
         (such as BACKGROUND_UP column in a Chandra grating pha2.fits files).


    (backfile="%") [character string]
         Associated background filename to be written in  o/p  file,  as
        the  value  of   the  BACKFILE  keyword.  The  default value "%"
        indicates that the BACKFILE keyword value will  be  copied  from
        the input file.   file.
    
    (corrfile="%") [character string]
         Associated  correction  filename  to be written in o/p file, as
        the value of   the  CORRFILE  keyword.  The  default  value  "%"
        indicates  that  the CORRFILE keyword  value will be copied from
        the input file.
    
    (arfile="%") [character string]
         Associated ancillary response filename to  be  written  in  o/p
        file,  as  the value  of the ANCRFILE keyword. The default value
        "%" indicates that the ANCRFILE  keyword value  will  be  copied
        from the input file.
    
    (rmfile="%") [character string]
         Associated  redistribution matrix filename to be written in o/p
        file, as the  value of the RESPFILE keyword. The  default  value
        "%"  indicates  that  the  RESPFILE keyword value will be copied
        from the input file.
    
    (chatter = 9) [integer]
         Flag to indicate how chatty the task is at execution.  A  value
        of  9  is  the   default,  with  lower/higher  values  producing 
        quieter/verbose output  respectively.
    
    (clobber = false) [boolean]
         Flag specifying whether or not a  pre-existing  file  with  the
        same  name  as that  requested as the output file from this task
        will be overwritten.
    
    
    
BUGS
     The routine to parse the ROWS parameter only has a primitive error
     handling capabilities; an incorrect input here could cause unexpected
     behaviors.Otherwise, none known.
