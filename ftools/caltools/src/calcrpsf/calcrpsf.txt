NAME
    calcrpsf -- multi-task wrapper for Radial PSF tools
    
    
USAGE
    calcrpsf
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
      This  task  is  a  multi-task  'wrapper'  (essentially  a  FORTRAN 
    script)    to    run   several   ftools   associated   with   Radial  
    (1-dimensional) Point  Spread  Functions  (RPSFs).  In  the  current
    build, the following tasks are supported:
    
    st2rpsf
         Reads  i/p  data  from  a FITS file produced by stwfits (within
        the    stsdas/fitsio   sub-package)   assumed   to   contain   a  
        1-dimensional  radial  profile   of  a  image, and writes an o/p
        RPSF dataset in OGIP-standard format.
    
    rbnrpsf
         Rebins an RPSF dataset  such  that  a  user-defined  number  of
        'source'  counts   are  contained  within each bin, and writes a
        new file containing the results.
    
    one of the following tasks to generate a theoretical RPSF dataset:
        pcrpsf
             for the ROSAT PSPC (with a number of  user-defined  options
            available).
        
        hrirpsf
             for the ROSAT HRI
    
    rpsfqdp
         Reads  an observed RPSF dataset and writes the data to an ASCII
        file along  with QDP commands  to  enable  QDP/PLT  to  be  used
        directly    on    the    o/p    file.      In    additional,   a  
        theoretical/predicted RPSF dataset  can  be  read  and   written
        such that QDP/PLT will overlay it on the same curve.
    
     One,  some  or all of these tasks can be spawned automatically from
    within calcrpsf, as dictated by the input  parameters  (see  below).
    More  detailed  help  on  the  individual  tasks  can  of  course by
    obtained by using the command "fhelp {task}".
    
      As Users Guide for this task  (CAL/SW/93-011),  which  contains  a
    more  detailed description of the task, protential problems, as well
    as examples is available via  the  OGIP  anonymous  ftp  acoount  on
    legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov      (in      Postscript)     as     caldb/docs    
    /memos/cal_sw_93_011.ps.
    
    
    
    
SUPPORTED FITS FILE FORMATS
    
       With the exception of  the  format  conversion  tasks  st2rpsf  &
    rpsfqdp,  all  tasks  read  &  write  FITS files which adhere to the
    format given in OGIP Calibration memo CAL/GEN/92-020. This  document
    is    available    via   the   OGIP   anonymous   ftp   acoount   on  
    legacy.gsfc.nasa.gov     (in     Postscript)      as      caldb/docs    
    /memos/cal_gen_92_020.ps.
    
    
    
    
WARNINGS ON USAGE
    
    The  following  temporary  files  can  be  generated  in  the  local 
    directory  by  calcrpsf  during  its  execution.  Which  files   are 
    actually  created by a given calcrpsf run obviously depends on which
    combination of tasksare spawned:
    
    (A) st2rpsf.tmp (by st2rpsf)
    
    (B) rbnrpsf.tmp (by rbnrpsf)
    
    (C) rpsfpred.tmp (by any of the RPSF generators)
    
    All these  files  should  be  automatically  removed  on  successful
    execution.   However  under  certain  circumstances  (eg if calcrpsf
    crashes) this might not be the case, and  the  files  can/should  be
    removed manually.
    
      Since  this  task  spawns  other  ftools, it is crucial that users
    have their account properly set up. Specifically,  users  must  have
    the  path  to  their  local  copy of the ftools executables, and the
    environment variables pointing to the local system & user copies  of
    the  parameter  files  defined  within  the set-up files executed by
    such spawned  jobs.  For  example,  users  running  the  c-shell  on
    unix/ultrix  platforms  must  have  the  above  defined within their
    .cshrc file (NOT their .login  file).   Users  who  use  the  ftools
    initialization  procedures  recommended  by  a  given ftools release
    should experience no difficulties. Those that do not  are  on  their
    own.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    
    infil [character string]
        The  name of the input file. The file required obviously depends
        upon which tasks are to be spawned as detailed below. Users  who
        simply  want  to generate a theoretical RPSF dataset for a given
        mission should specify infil=NONE.
    
    outfil [character string]
        The name of the output file. The task which produces the  output
        file  obviously  depends  upon  which  is  the  last  task to be
        spawned (as detailed below).
    
    qst2rpsf [boolean]
        Logical flag indicating  whether  the  task  st2rpsf  is  to  be
        spawned.   If  yes,  then the value of the infil parameter above
        should be the name of the FITS file produced by stwfits.  If  no
        other  tasks  are  to  be spawned from within calcrpsf, then the
        value of the outfil parameter should be the name of the  desired
        o/p  file.  (If other tasks are spawned, then intermediate files
        will be produced & removed whilst calcrpsf is  executing).  This
        parameter is not required if infil=NONE.
    
    qrbnrpsf [boolean]
        Logical  flag  indicating  whether  the  task  rbnrpsf  is to be
        spawned.  If yes, but st2rpsf has NOT been run, then  the  value
        of  the  infil  parameter  above  should be the name of the FITS
        file (in OGIP-standard format)  to  be  rebinned.  If  no  other
        tasks  are  to  be  spawned  after rbnrpsf from within calcrpsf,
        then the value of the outfil parameter should  be  the  name  of
        the  desired  o/p  file.  (If  other  tasks  are  spawned,  then 
        intermediate files will be produced &  removed  whilst  calcrpsf
        is executing). This parameter is not required if infil=NONE.
    
    qpred [character string (pseudo-boolean)]
        This  string  indicates  whether  one  of the available tasks to
        generate a theoretical  RPSF  dataset  is  to  be  spawned.  Its
        allowed  values  are  the same as for a boolean (eg 'yes', 'no',
        'true', 'false'  etc  etc),  but  with  the  addition  that  the
        special  value  '?'  will  list the instruments for which such a
        theoretical RPSF generator is available.  If a theoretical  RPSF
        dataset  is  requested, but NEITHER st2rpsf OR rbnrpsf have been
        run, then the value of  the infil parameter above should be  the
        name  of the FITS file to which the  theoretical RPSF dataset is
        to be  appended.  If  infil=NONE,  then  the   theoretical  RPSF
        dataset  will  be written to a new FITS file. If rpsfqdp is  NOT
        to be spawned afterwards from within calcrpsf,  then  the  value
        of  the   outfil parameter should be the name of the desired o/p
        file. (If rpsfqdp is  spawned, then an  intermediate  file  will
        be produced & removed whilst  calcrpsf is executing).
    
    telescop  [character string]
        The  name  of  the mission on which the instrument for which the
        theoretical RPSF dataset is required.  This  parameter  is  only
        required by calcrpsf if infil=NONE, and qpred=yes.
    
    instrume [character string]
        The  name of the instrume for which the theoretical RPSF dataset
        is required. This parameter is  only  required  by  calcrpsf  if
        infil=NONE, and qpred=yes.
    
    qrpsfqdp [boolean]
        Logical  flag  indicating  whether  the  task  rpsfqdp  is to be
        spawned.  If yes, but NONE of the other tasks  are  to  be  run,
        then  the  value of the infil parameter above should be the name
        of the FITS file (in OGIP-standard format) to  be  converted  to
        an  ASCII  QDP file. The value of the outfil parameter should be
        the name of the desired o/p file.
    
    (chatter = 9) [integer]
        Integer flag to indicate how chatty the task is at execution.  A
        value  of  9  is the default, with lower/higher values producing
        quieter/verbose output respectively.
    
    (schatter = 5) [integer]
        Integer flag to indicate how chatty the spawned  tasks  will  be
        during  their  execution.  A  value  of  5  is the default, with
        lower/higher    values    producing    quieter/verbose    output   
        respectively.
    
    (clobber = false) [boolean]
         Flag  specifying  whether  or  not a pre-existing file with the
        same name as that  requested as the output file from  this  task
        will be overwritten.
