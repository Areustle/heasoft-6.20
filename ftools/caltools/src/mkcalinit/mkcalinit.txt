NAME
    mkcalinit -- Create a caldbinit file
    
    
USAGE
    mkcalinit
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task will create a caldbinit file  which  contains  the  system
    specific  commands  necessary  to  set  the  CALDB  and  CALDBCONFIG 
    environment variables or logicals. On  UNIX  systems  the  caldbinit
    file  is  created in the subdirectory "software/tools" and is called
    caldbinit.unix. On VMS systems the caldbinit file is created in  the
    subdirectory  "[.software.tools]" and is called caldbinit.vms. Caldb
    users can execute this file to initialize their  session  for  Caldb
    access. See the Caldb help page for additional information on how to
    use the caldbinit  file.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    (configdir = software/tools) [string]
        Path  to  the  file  defined  by  the  CALDBCONFIG   environment 
        variable  (or  logical).   The default value (software/tools) is
        the standard location within the  local  CALDB  directory  tree.
        This  parameter  should  only be altered by local CALDB managers
        who know what they are doing as an incorrect value may  lead  to
        failure  of  the  task  and/or  copies  of the caldb.config file
        being installed on their system.
    
    (chatter = 9) [integer]
        Flag to indicate how chatty the task is at  execution.  A  value
        of   9  is  the  default,  with  lower/higher  values  producing 
        quieter/verbose  output  respectively.   A  value  of  chatter=0 
        gives  totally  silent  running,  with  the  exception  of error
        messages.
