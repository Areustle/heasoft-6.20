NAME
    rpsf2eef  --  Converts  a  radial  PSF  (RPSF)  dataset  to a radial
    encircled energy function (REEF) dataset.
    
    
USAGE:
    rpsf2eef infil outfil
    
    
DESCRIPTION:
    This task converts a Radial Point-Spread Function (RPSF) dataset  to
    a  Radial Encircled-Energy Fraction (REEF) dataset.  An RPSF dataset
    consists of the number of counts per unit  area  as  a  function  of
    radius  (using  series of concentric annular bins).  An REEF dataset
    consists of the fraction of the total (source) counts  encircled  as
    a function of radius (again using concentric annular bins).
    
    Should   it   be  necessary,  the  task  will  subtract  a  constant 
    background during the calculation of the  REEF  dataset,  and  hence
    for  a  central point source the REEF should asymptotically approach
    unity towards high radii.  The task checks if the total  theoretical
    counts  parameter  (SUMTCTS)  is  supplied in the input file, and if
    not, then it is calculated within the code.
    
    
WARNINGS ON USAGE:
    
    
PARAMETERS:
    
    infil [character string]
        The name of the input FITS  file  containing  the  Point  Spread
        Function for the observational data.
    
    (predfil="%") [character string]
        The  name  of  the  input  FITS file containing the Point Spread
        Function for the theoretical data.  The default  special  string
        "%"  indicates  that the task will assume the input file (infil)
        contains both observational and theoretical datasets.
    
    outfil [character string]
        The name of the output FITS  file  containing  Encircled  Energy
        Fraction for the observational and/or theoretical data.
    
    (chatter=9) [integer]
        Flag  to  set  how chatty the task is at execution.  The default
        value is 9, with lower/higher values  producing  quieter/verbose
        output respectively.
    
    (clobber = false) [boolean]
        Flag  specifying  whether  or  not  a  pre-existing file will be
        overwritten.
