NAME
    cifcadd  --  add a new column, CAL_ORIG, to a Calibration Index File
    (CIF)
    
    
USAGE
    cifcadd mission instrument instru_alias (calfexp) (chatter) (mode)
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
     This task is a maintenance task  for  CALDB  managers.   It  merely
    adds  an  extra  column,  CAL_ORIG,  to  a caldb.indx file. CAL_ORIG
    indicates the scientific institute from which each cal file  indexed
    in  the  caldb.indx  originated.  The task sets the DEFAULT value of
    CAL_ORIG for each cal file to 'HEASARC'.
    
    As input, the task requires:
    
    (i)  the mission & instrument whose CIF is to be changed
    
    (ii) the name of any alias for the instrument (doesnt  matter  which
    is  entered)       i.e.  for  ASCA  XRT  the aliases are XRT1, XRT2,
    XRT3, XRT4            for  ASCA  SIS  the  aliases  are  SIS0,  SIS1
               for  ASCA  XRT  the aliases are GIS2, GIS3            for
    ROSAT PSPC the aliases are PSPCB, PSPCC
    
         If an  instrument  has  no  alias  (i.e.  XTE  PCA)  then  just
    re-enter the name of the instrument (i.e. PCA).
    
    The  alias  info  is  required  by a subroutine which determines the
    path to a CIF.
    
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    
    mission [character string]
         The name of the mission
    
    instrument [character string]
         The name of the instrument
    
    instru_alias [character string]
         The name of the instrument alias
    
    (calfexp=CALDB) [character string] 
         The name of the environment variable.
    
    (chatter = 9) [integer]
         Flag to indicate how chatty the task is at execution.  A  value
        of  9  is  the   default,  with  lower/higher  values  producing 
        quieter/verbose output  respectively.
    
    (mode = "ql") [character string]
