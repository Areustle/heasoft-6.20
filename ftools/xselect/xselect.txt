                            XSELECT HELP

XSELECT is an interactive program to examine input event files, filter
these to include events of interest then create data products for further
analysis.  It performs many of these functions by running individual tasks
from the FTOOLS suite. Version 2.2 and later also use tasks from CIAO and SAS.

To start the program simply type xselect. An interactive help facility is
available using:
