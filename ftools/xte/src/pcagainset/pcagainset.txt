NAME
    pcagainset  -- insert PCA/EDS gain and offset values into a PCA .pha
    file.
    
    
USAGE
    pcagainset phafile gainfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task writes the PCA/EDS gain and offset values into a PCA  .pha
    file  for  those  data  modes  in which the gain and offset has been
    applied by the EDS.  This  customarily  includes  all  PCA/EDS  data
    modes  except  for  GoodXenon, Transparent and Standard Mode 2.  The
    task looks for the GAINAPP keyword.  If true, the  values  from  the
    input  gain  file  are  written into the .pha file.  Existing values
    found  in  the  .pha  file  will  be  overwritten  unless  specified 
    otherwise  by  the  user.   The  values  are written as PCUnGAIN and
    PCUnOFST keywords (n = 0-4), and  are  later  read  by  the  RDDESCR
    ftool and used by the GCORRMF ftool.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    phafile [file name]
        The name of the input PCA .pha file.
    
    gainfile [file name]
        The  name  of  the  input  gain  and offset calibration file.  A
        value of "caldb" may be used  to  retrieve  the  file  from  the
        calibration database.
    
    (update = yes) [logical]
        Whether to update existing gain and offset values.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1. pcagainset phafile=sac.pha gainfile=edsgcor_950818.fits
    
    Insert the gain and offset values from the file edsgcor_950818.fits
    into the file sac.pha.  Any exisiting PCUnGAIN and PCUnOFST values
    will be over-written.
