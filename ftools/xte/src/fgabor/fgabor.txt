NAME
    fgabor --  Perform a Gabor transform on a lightcurve and return  the
    normalized power as a function of time and frequency.
    
    
USAGE
    fgabor  infile  fmin  fmax  nfreq  window  outfile timeunits ratecol
    extname maxgap winfrac sigma normalize quiet clobber
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The Gabor transform takes a function  of  one  variable,  time,  and
    maps it to a function of two variables, time and frequency:
                           f(t) -> G(t,k)
    For  each  frequency  k,  the  function  of  time only G(*,k) is the
    result of convolving the function f  with  a  kernel  which  is  the
    product  of  a  fixed Gaussian window and the complex exponential of
    frequency k.  So of G(*,k) is a filtered  version  of  the  original
    function (or signal) f.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [string - file name]
        The  name of the input FITS file containing the lightcurve to be
        analyzed.  Any OGIP-compliant  lightcurve  should  work,  though
        you  may  need  to  set  the  ratecol  and/or extname parameters
        appropriately (see below).
    
    fmin [real - minimum frequency]
        The minimum frequency to be considered in the transform.  Should
        be  greater  than  ndata/window.  Measured  in  either  Hertz or
        cycles per dataset, depending on the setting  of  the  timeunits
        parameter (see below).
    
    fmax [real - maximum frequency]
        The  maximum frequency to be considered in the transform. Should
        be less than than the  Nyquist  frequency.  Measured  in  either
        Hertz  or  cycles  per  dataset, depending on the setting of the
        timeunits parameter (see below).
    
    nfreq [integer - number of frequencies]
        The number of frequencies to use between fmin and fmax. Must  be
        at  least  two.  Too  high  a  value will result in a very large
        output  file  and  will  consume  proportionally   more   system 
        resources during the computation.
    
    window = INDEF [real - window size]
        The  size  (+/-  3  sigma)  of the Gaussian window to use in the
        transform.  Should be specified in either  number  of  timesteps
        or  in  seconds,  depending  on  the  setting  of  the timeunits
        parameter (see below, also fmin and fmax).  is used. If  set  to
        INDEF,  the  tool will choose a window size based on the size of
        the dataset and the winfrac parameter (see below).
    
    outfile = gaborpwr.fits [string - filename]
        The name for the output  FITS  file  containing  the  normalized
        power  array  and  a  table  of  frequencies.  Use  the  clobber 
        parameter to allow the tool to overwrite a preexisting file.
    
    (timeunits = yes) [boolean - use time units]
        If "yes" then the fmin,  fmax  and  window  parameters  will  be
        interpreted  as  units  of Hz and seconds, respectively. If "no"
        then they will be taken to be in cycles per dataset  and  number
        of rows instead.
    
    (ratecol = RATE) [string - rate column name]
        The  name  of  the  column in the input file containing the rate
        information.
    
    (extname = RATE) [string - lightcurve extension name]
        The name of the extension (EXTNAME keyword) which  contains  the
        lightcurve in the input FITS file.
    
    (maxgap = 0.10) [real - maximum gapsize]
        Defines  the  maximum  number  of  consecutive  rows  which  are 
        missing or which contain NULL rates (as a fraction of the  total
        size  of the dataset).  Up to this limit rows which contain NULL
        rate values or are missing will be replaced by  random  Gaussian
        noise prior to performing the Gabor transform.
    
    (winfrac = 0.20) [real - default INDEF window]
        Default  window  size  (as  a  fraction of the total size of the
        dataset) used when the window parameter (see above)  is  set  to
        INDEF.
    
    (sigma = INDEF) [real - Standard deviation for random noise]
        When  set  to INDEF (the default) the Gaussian used to fill NULL
        and/or missing values will be defined by the  computed  standard
        deviation  of  the  existing  rate values. This parameter allows
        users to instead set this standard deviation explicitly.
    
    (normalize = yes) [boolean - Normalize output power?]
        The default behavior is to normalize the output power to 1.   If
        this  parameter  is  set  to  "no" the normalization will not be
        done.
    
    (quiet = no) [boolean]
        If set to "yes" all standard output will be supressed.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        Overwrite existing output file having the same name?
    
    (mode = ql) [string]
        FTOOLS internal -- users should not need to change.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    
    
NOTES:
    The output FITS file  will  include  three  data  units.  The  first
    (primary  array)  will  contain the result of the Gabor transform: a
    FITS image with dimensions of nfreq x nrows. The  second  data  unit
    (first  extension) is a binary table listing the frequencies used in
    the  tranform,  in  units  of  either  Hz  or  cycles  per  dataset, 
    depending  on  the  setting  of  the timeunits parameter.  The third
    data unit (second extension) is a  binary  table  which  contains  a
    copy  of  the data on which the transform was actually performed, ie
    with the mean value subtracted and with time gaps  and  NULL  values
    filled with random, Gaussian-distributed noise.
