NAME
    pcaclrsp -- creates a collimator corrected light curve  for  an  XTE
    PCA input light curve.
    
    
USAGE
    pcaclrsp lcfile outfile xtefilt pcu collcube
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  computes  the collimator correction for an XTE PCA light
    curve.  It computes the correction from the source position and  the
    instrument pointing.  If the jitter in the pointing is less than the
    nominal jitter, then an average pointing  is  used  for  the  entire
    light  curve.  The collimator correction value corresponding to this
    average pointing is stored as  a  keyword  value  in  the  extension
    header  of  the  output  file.   If  the  jitter is greater than the
    nominal jitter, then the current pointing is used for each  time  in
    the  light  curve.   In  the  latter case, if the sampling (i.e. bin
    size) in the light curve is less  than  the  sampling  rate  in  the
    pointing,  then  the pointing is obtained via interpolation.  On the
    other hand, if the sampling in the light curve is larger  than  that
    of  the  pointing, then an average pointing over the duration of the
    bin is used.  The user may override  the  nominal  jitter  criterion
    via the hidden jitter parameter.
    
    If  the  source lies outside of the field of view, a warning message
    is given and the returned intensity is set to INDEF  for  that  time
    stamp.   The  input  file is copied to the output file.  Intensities
    for times lying outside the desired start and stop times  are  given
    a  value of INDEF.  When quaternions are not available for a desired
    time, the rate is also given a value of INDEF.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    lcfile [file name]
        The name of the input light curve file.  Currently, only  scalar
        ("type  I")  files  are  handled  intentionally.  Vectored light
        curve files ("type II") may be handled correctly by accident.
    
    outfile [file name]
        The name of the output light curve file.
    
    xtefilt [file name]
        The file containing the satellite pointing  for  the  input  pha
        file.    This  may  be  either  the  XTE  FILTER  file,  or  the 
        quaternion file (FH0e...).  The user may  also  input  an  ascii
        file @filename containing the path to the file.
    
    collcube [file name]
        The  name  of  the collimator cube file for the appropriate pcu.
        A value of CALDB (or  "caldb")  will  retrieve  the  appropriate
        cube from the calibration database.
    
    pcu [string]
        The  pcu  of  interest,  numbered  0-4  or  "all" for sum of all
        detectors.
    
    (ra = 'INDEF')  [real*4]
        An alternate right ascension for the object.
    
    (dec = 'INDEF')  [real*4]
        An alternate declination for the object.
    
    (area_pcu(0-4) = 1400.0) [real*4]
        The geometric area of each pcu.
    
    (area_pca = 7000.0) [real*4]
        The geometric area of the entire PCA.
    
    (jitter= 20.0) [real*4]
        The acceptable amount of jitter in the spacecraft  pointing,  in
        arc seconds.
    
    (start = -1.) [real*4]
        An alternate start time for the observation.
    
    (stop = -1.) [real*4]
        An alternate stop time for the observation.
    
    (chatter = 9) [integer]
        The standard chatter parameter.
    
    (clobber = no) [string]
        Delete output file if it exists ?  (Override with !filename)
    
    (arfversn = 1.1.0) [string]
        Version number for the type of .arf file to output
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   pcaclrsp std2one.lc std2oneclrsp.lc FH0e_2e89a5c-2e90abf all CALDB
      
      Construct the collimated corrected light curve for the file std2one.lc, 
    using the quaternion files FH0e_2e89a5c-2e90abf.  The input file represents
    the intensity from all the detectors (pcu=all).  The collimator cube file
    will be fetched from caldb, and the output light curve will be written to 
    std2oneclrsp.lc.
