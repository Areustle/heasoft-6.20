NAME
    fbfsum -- Averages fB files in phase, by summing rows together.
    
    
USAGE
    fbfsum infile outfile binstep binstart binstop clobber
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Fbfsum  performs  averaging  of  fB  files in phase by summing rows,
    without requiring the user to run fasebin again.  However,  it  will
    only  do  so  in an integer number of rows at a time.  It does allow
    the user, though, to set the row  where  the  summing  is  to  start
    which  determines the exact placement of the new bin centers.  Also,
    it does not require summing the entire phase range  present  in  the
    input file by the user's specifying the end row.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [string]
        Input file name; this needs to be an fB file.
    
    outfile = fBfsum.pha [string]
        Output  file  name;  if  no  extension  is  given ".pha" will be
        appended.
    
    binstep = 5 [integer] 
        The number of phase bins (rows) to be averaged into the new bin.
    
    (binstart) [integer] 
        The first row to include (default: first row in file)
    
    (binstop) [integer] 
        The last row to include (default: last row in file)
    
    (clobber = yes) [boolean]
        Should a pre-existing output file be overwritten?
    
    (mode = ql) [string]
        FTOOLS internal -- users should not need to change.
