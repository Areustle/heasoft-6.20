HXTDEAD (1)                    14 Jan 1998                   HXTDEAD (1)



NAME
    hxtdead - a program that corrects a HEXTE spectral  or  light  curve
    FITS  file  for  detector  dead  time, including correction for time
    lost to the rocking motion.  The  program  is applied  to   .pha  or
    .lc   files produced by seextrct or saextrct from a single FITS file
    of HEXTE event-list data or archive data, respectively.
    
    
USAGE
    hxtdead    ["coefficients_file"     "rates_file"      "science_file"   
    "file_to_correct"]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    If  the  input file list is not present, the hxtdead program queries
    the user for a calibration file and three HEXTE files  spanning  the
    data  interval:  the   16-second   housekeeping   file  (FH53...  or 
    FH59...), the science data file  (FS50... or FS56... or  FS52...  or
    FS58...  )  which  was  input  to seextrct, and finally the spectral
    (.pha) or light curve (.lc) file to be corrected.  The  coefficients
    files,  one  for  each  cluster, may be installed in the calibration
    data base and are then most conveniently referred to with  the  word
    CALDB.   After obtaining the inputs, hxtdead first collects counting
    rates of discriminators upon which  dead  time  depends.   Next   it
    reads  the science data file for the value of the dead time counter,
    calculates the live time for each 16-sec frame  of  data,   and  the
    running  sum.  Finally the spectral or light curve file is modified.
    The keyword DEADAPP is inserted, with value T.  Spectral  files  are
    given  a  new,  smaller,  value  for  the  EXPOSURE keyword, and the
    previous value  is  written  to  a  new  keyword,  OLDEXP.   If  the
    spmode=RATE  option to the extract program was employed, rather than
    SUM, the values of the RATE and STAT_ERR  column  are  also  revised
    upwards.   Light  curve  files with the lcmode=RATE option, not SUM,
    are supported.  These  have  a  new  column  DEADLC  written,  whose
    values  are  in the range 0.4 to 0.7, and the RATE and ERROR columns
    are rewritten with larger  values  determined  from  the  dead  time
    correction.  The saextrct option accum=MANY is supported.

EXAMPLES
    
    1. hxtdead
    
    User  will be prompted for filenames.  The spectral or  light  curve
    file  selected  from the last prompt will be modified.  If spectral,
    then the keyword EXPOSURE is modified.  If a  light  curve  in  RATE
    format,  then  it  will  have  a new column, DEADLC, written and the
    values of the RATE and ERROR columns  are  revised  upwards.   Other
    keywords  are  added  to  indicate  that the file has been dead-time
    corrected.
    
    2. hxtdead caldb FH53_3f3ad0b-3f3b060 d0b-3f3b040_src FS50_3f3ad0b-3f3b040_src.pha
    
    Script will run without prompting,  using  as  input  the  dead-time
    coefficients  file  in the calibration data base and the three files
    FHfd_3f3ad0b-3f3b080,                          FH53_3f3ad0b-3f3b060,                        
    FS50_3f3ad0b-3f3b040_src,   FS50_3f3ad0b-3f3b040_src.pha.  The  last
    file  will have the value of the EXPOSURE keyword changed, and other
    new keywords added.
    
    3. hxtdead hxtdead_97jul2_pwa.fits FH53_3f3ad0b-3f3b060 FS50_3f3ad0b-3f3b040_src FS50_3f3ad0b-3f3b040_src.lc
    
    Script  will  run  without  prompting,   using   as   input the four
    files         hxtdead_97jul2_pwa.fits,         FH53_3f3ad0b-3f3b060,       
    FS50_3f3ad0b-3f3b040_src,    FS50_3f3ad0b-3f3b040_src.lc.    If  the 
    accumulation was performed with the  lcmode=RATE  option  The   last
    file   will  have a new column, DEADC, written and the values in the
    RATE and ERROR columns will be revised upwards.
    
    
NOTES:
    The program works for event-list and any archive data, but  not  for
    other  binned  data modes. The SEEXTRCT and SAEXTRCT spmode=MEAN and
    lcmode=MEAN  modes  are  also  not  supported.  Light  curve   files 
    accumulated  with  the  lcmode=SUM  option are not supported.  For a
    very  few  data  files  in  the  early  mission,   when   instrument 
    parameters  were  being  changed, the program will stop and complain
    that the XULD duration was not constant.  The only fix is  to  split
    up  the  file(s)  with  fselect.   For  archive  data  created  with 
    versions  of  XFF  earlier  than  5.3.1,  hxtdead   quits   with   a 
    not-very-helpful   message   if   the   third   argument   was   the  
    hxtback-selected  data  file.   The  fix  is  to  rerun  using   the 
    XFF-produced  file  directly,  i.  e., no _bkg or _src at the end of
    the file name.  The list-of-files option for input  to  the  extract
    programs  is  NOT  supported.   It is very important to use the most
    up-to-date version of the extract tools.  hxtdead assumes that  each
    data  set  has  housekeeping  files  which  completely  overlap  the 
    science data files.  This is occasionally untrue, and  hxtdead  will
    stop  with  an  informative message.  The only fix is to rewrite the
    science file(s) to start later or end earlier, as needed.
