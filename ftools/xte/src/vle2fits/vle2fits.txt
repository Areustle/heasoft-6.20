VLE2FITS (1.0)                  Apr97                 VLE2FITS (1.0)



NAME
    vle2fits  --  creates  either a Science Event (SE) file, or a file
    containing a separate column for each  flag,  from  processing  good
    vle 1, and 2 data from PCA instruments.
    
    
USAGE
    vle2fits vle1, vle2, outfile, wrtparm, clobber
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  takes as input good vle 1, and 2 data and will produce
    a science event (SE) FITS file that can be processed with  SEEXTRCT,
    SEBITMASK,  or  SESELECT,  or  will  produce  a file with a separate
    column for each flag in the good vle data but showing  the  actual
    values  associated  with  each flag that is contained within the bit
    stream in the SE data.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    vle1 [string - file name or @filename]
        The name of the input FITS file (and extension number in  square
        brackets  or with a + sign in front) which contains good vle 1
        data, or a file containing several input FITS  filenames  to  be
        acted  upon which is denoted by an "at" sign (@file_of_infiles).
        When the "at"-mode is used the file must contain  the  names  of
        the  two  files  to  be processed and their extension number. If
        the "at" sign is used then "vle2" is ignored! (Actually  if  a
        single  filename  is input it can contain good vle 1 or 2 data
        and the code will compare it to  the  input  files  from  vle2
        determine  which  file  contains which type of data.) [NOTE: YOU
        CANNOT GIVE AN ARBITRARY NUMBER OF  FILES  TO  BE  PROCESSED  TO
        VLE2FITS  -  IT  HANDLES  ONLY 2. USE MAKE_SE IF YOU HAVE MANY
        VLE FILES TO BE CONVERTED.]
    
    vle2 [string - file name]
        The name of the input FITS file (and extension number in  square
        brackets  or with a + sign in front) which contains good vle 2
        data. If the "at" sign was used in "vle1"  then  the  "vle2"
        parameter  is  ignored! (Actually this filename can contain good
        vle 1 or 2 data and the code will  compare  it  to  the  input
        files from vle1 to determine which file contains which type of
        data.)
    
    outfile [string - file name]
                The name of the output file  to  contain  the  processed
        data.
    
    wrtparm [character - X (SE output FITS) or A(SCII output FITS) file]
        This  parameter  is  used to determine which mode is used in the
        output data. The output data can either  be  a  bit-stream  with
        the  data in the same form as SE data (X), or can be in a format
        that has each flag in a separate column so that it  is  easy  to
        determine  which  flags were set and what their values are. When
        in X mode the output is in two  columns  TIME  and  Event  where
        Event  is  a 24X bit-stream. And when A mode is used the columns
        are "TIME", "PCUID",  "PulseHeight",  "Propane",  "XL1",  "XR1",
        "XL2", "XR2", "XL3", "XR3".
    
    clobber = yes [boolean]
        Tells if existing output files are to be overwritten.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.   Process  good  vle  data  files  and produce either a science
    event file or a file with a separate column for each flag.
