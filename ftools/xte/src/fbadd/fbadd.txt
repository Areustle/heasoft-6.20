NAME
    fbadd -- Adds several commensurate fB files together
    
    
USAGE
    fbadd infile outfile clobber
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Adds  several  fB  files  together,  provided they are commensurate.
    This tool is useful for combining data  from  different  days  which
    cannot  be  combined  in  any other way since they require different
    orbit ephemeris files.
    
    "Commensurate" means in this context: the same energy  channel  bins
    and  the  same phase bins.  The program does not check whether there
    is any  overlap  between  the  input  files,  though;  the  user  is
    expected not to specify foolish requests.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [string]
        Name  of  the  input  fB  file  (produced  by  fasebin)  or,  if 
        preceeded by a "@", the name of a  file  containing  a  list  of
        such files (ie, @filelist).
    
    outfile = fBadd.pha [string]
        Name of the combined fB file.
    
    (clobber = yes) [boolean]
        Should a pre-existing output file be overwritten?
    
    (mode = ql) [string]
        FTOOLS internal -- users should not need to change.
