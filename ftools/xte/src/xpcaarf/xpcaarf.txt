NAME
    xpcaarf  --  creates  a .arf file for an input XTE PCA .pha and .rmf
    files
    
    
USAGE
    xpcaarf phafil rmffil arffil xtefilt collcube pcu
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task computes the collimator corrected  effective  area  for  a
    given  source  position  and  satellite pointing position for an XTE
    PCA observation.  It matches the energy grid of the  resulting  .arf
    file to the input .rmf file.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    phafil [file name]
        The  name of the input .pha file.  Both Type I (single spectrum)
        and Type II (multiple spectra) files are supported.
    
    rmffil [file name]
        The  name  of  the  input  .rmf  file.   This  file  should   be 
        appropriate  for  the  input  .pha  file  (i.e  match  TELESCOP, 
        INSTRUME, and DETNAM keywords), and is used for the energy  grid
        for the output .arf file.
    
    arffil [file name]
        The name of the output .arf file.
    
    xtefilt [file name]
        The  file  containing  the  satellite pointing for the input pha
        file.  This may be either the XTE FILTER  file,  the  quaternion
        file  (FH0e...),  or  of  the  form  @filename for an ascii file
        containing the name and path of the file.  If this pointing file
        is  unavailable or inadequate, a value of 'none' may be entered,
        in which case an arf file assuming an on-axis pointing  will  be
        created.
    
    collcube [file name]
        The  name  of  the collimator cube file for the appropriate pcu.
        A value of 'caldb' may  be  used  to  search  the  user's  caldb
        directory for the appropriate file.
    
    pcu [integer]
        The pcu of interest (numbered 0-4).
    
    (area_pcu(0-4) = 15XX.X) [real*4]
        The geometric area of each pcu.
    
    (jitter = 20.0) [real*4]
        The  acceptable  amount of jitter in the spacecraft pointing, in
        seconds of arc.
    
    (ra = 'INDEF')  [real*4]
        An alternate right ascension for the object.
    
    (dec = 'INDEF')  [real*4]
        An alternate declination for the object.
    
    (start = -1) [real*4]
        The start time for the observation.  Start time defaults to  the
        value in the pha file.
    
    (stop = -1) [real*4]
        The  stop  time  for the observation.  Stop time defaults to the
        value in the pha file.
    
    (y_boresite = 0.0) [real*4]
        The PCA boresite direction along the spacecraft  y  axis.   This
        value   is  used  in  the  pointing  direction  when  'none'  is 
        specified for the XTE Filter file.  Note that this value  should
        NEVER be changed unless instructed to do so by the XTE GOF.
    
    (z_boresite = 0.0007) [real*4]
        The  PCA  boresite  direction along the spacecraft z axis.  This
        value  is  used  in  the  pointing  direction  when  'none'   is 
        specified  for the XTE Filter file.  Note that this value should
        NEVER be changed unless instructed to do so by the XTE GOF.
    
    (chatter = 9) [integer]
        The standard chatter parameter for how much to  tell  the  user.
        larger values give more information.
    
    (clobber = no) [string]
        Delete output file if it exists ?  (Override with !filename)
    
    (arfversn = 1.1.0) [string]
        Version number for the type of .arf file to output
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1. xpcaarf std2one.pha std2one.rmf std2one.arf FH0e_2e89a5c-2e90abf
    caldb 2
       This will create the arf file std2one.arf for the input pha file
    std2one.pha using the channel binning in std2one.rmf.  The XTE
    quaternion file for the observation is given.  The caldb will be
    searched for the collimator cube appropriate for PCU2.
