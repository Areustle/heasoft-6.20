DESCRIPTION
    xtetape examines the contents of XTE FITS  data  distribution  tapes
    and  then  reads  those  files selected by the user. The tape format
    must conform to  the  NASA/GSFC  Astrophysics  Data  Facility  (ADF)
    standard.  This standard mandates that the first tape file contain a
    FITS file  with  a  single  ASCII  table  extension  describing  the
    contents  of  the  rest of the tape. If the tape was not made by the
    ADF, or does not conform to this standard, then xtetape cannot  read
    the tape.
    
    Users  may  choose  to unload the entire contents of the tape (which
    usually takes up a lot of disk space) or certain classes  of  files.
    The following file classes are supported:
    
    
    Entire tape contents
    
    
    XFF index files
    
    
    Proportional Counter Array (PCA) instrument files
    
    
    HEXTE instrument files
    
    
    Electronic Data System (EDS) housekeeping files
    
    
    Attitude Control System (ACS) files
    
    
    Attitude Control Electronics (ACE) and star tracker files
    
    
    Flight Data System (FDS) files
    
    
    Gimbals and Solar Array Control Electronics (GSACE) files
    
    
    Instrument Power Switching and Distribution Unit (IPSDU) files
    
    
    Spacecraft Power Switching and Distribution Unit (SPSDU) files
    
    
    Power System Electronics (PSE) files
    
    
    Interferometric Fiber Optics Gyroscope (IFOG) files
    
    
    Orbit emphemeris files
    
    
    Time delta corrections (Clock) files
    
    
    Calibration files
    
    
    Standard science product files
    
    In  addition  to  loading  files  by  class, xtetape allows users to
    place the tape contents into its  original  GOF  (XFF)  subdirectory
    structure.  Using  this  subdirectory  structure  makes  for  a more
    organized and understandable loading of the tape contents.  If  this
    option  is  chosen  (make_dirs=yes) then xtetape creates a top level
    'FD' directory under the specified load directory (load_dir).  Under
    the  'FD'  directory subdirectores are created for each announcement
    of opportunity (AO)  phase,  proposal  ID  and  XTE  observation  ID
    (obsID)  for  which  data  is present on the tape. Under each of the
    AO/proposal_ID/obsID subdirectires a complete set of  subdirectories
    for the above listed data classes are created.
    
    The  user  may construct these directories ahead of time and xtetape
    will make use of the  existing  directories  instead  of  trying  to
    create  them. Thus, by creating the directories beforehand, symbolic
    links may be used to  spread  the  loaded  data  over  several  file
    systems (Unix only).
    
    As  a  final  option, xtetape allows users to find out how much disk
    space will be necessary to unload a  given  configuration  of  files
    before  the  files  are  unloaded.  Since  a  full XTE data tape can
    contain  many  hundreds  of  megabytes   of   files,   this   option 
    (check_size=yes)  is  often  useful  for users who have limited disk
    space. When the check_size option is  invoked  xtetape  will  report
    back  the number of kilobytes necessary to unload the
    selected file sets instead of actually unloading the  selected  file
    sets.  If  the  reported disk requirements are satisfactory then the
    user may rerun xtetape with the  check_size  option  turned  off  to
    load the files.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    The  following  are  the xtetape "mandatory" parameters that require
    answers each time the utility is run. If you do not specify them  on
    the  command  line  then  you will be prompted for them. In case you
    are unsure of what files are necessary to load from  tape,  choosing
    the  default  values  will  load  all  the  files necessary for data
    analysis.
    
    
    tape_drive [string] [no default]
        Name of the tape drive to read from. Note that on  Unix  systems
        the "no rewind" tape device driver must be specified.
    
    
    load_dir  [string] [no default]
        Absolute directory path of the area used to load the tape files.
    
    
    check_size [boolean] [default = no]

        selected file sets before unloading from tape
    
    
    make_dirs [boolean] [default = yes]
        Set  to  "yes"  to  create  and  use  the  recommended   default

    load_all  [boolean] [default = no]
        Set  to  "yes"  to  load  all files from the tape (uses a lot of

        Set to "yes" to load the instrument calibration files from tape.
    
    In addition to the mandatory  parameters,  there  are  two  "hidden"
    parameters  that  the  user  may choose set on the command line, but
    will not be prompted for:
    
    
    verbose [boolean] [default = no]
        Set to "yes" to get runtime status information.
    
    
    unwrap [boolean] [default = yes]
        Set to "yes" to unwrap FITS  wrapped  data  files  as  they  are
        unloaded.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    
    This  first  example  shows the simplest use of the xtetape Utility.
    Just by typing its  name  xtetape  will  prompt  the  user  for  all
    necessary  information.  And, by accepting all the default parameter
    values, the user will load from tape all files  necessary  for  data
    analysis:
    
    
    xtetape
    
    This  next example reports back to the user the amount of disk space
    needed to load all the files from the tape:
    
    
    xtetape load_all=yes check_size=yes
    
    If the returned space requirements were satisfactory then  the  same
    command  minus  the  "check_size=yes"  would  actually load all file
    sets.
    
    In all the examples above xtetape would  prompt  the  user  for  the
    tape  drive  name,  load  directory  name  and  all  other mandatory
    parameter values; thus, it is not necessary to specify these  values
    on the command line.
    
    
    
BUGS
    This  routine  has  been  tested  under  the  Solaris  2.3 operating
    system. While it should work under other OS, there is no guarantee.
    
    The weakest link  in  any  computer  system  are  the  tape  drives.
    Therefore,  if  your  tape  does not read correctly please make sure
    that the drive it is being read upon is  in  proper  working  order.
    Try  cleaning  the drive in the appropriate manner or re-reading the
    tape on a similar drive before giving up.
    
    8mm tape drive systems usually require 30 seconds or  more  to  load
    tapes.   Therefore, when using 8mm drives please wait an appropriate
    amount of time between loading the tape and  executing  the  xtetape
    task. Otherwise, a tape read error might result.
