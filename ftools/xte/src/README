       pcarmf - Creates a .rmf file for a specified anode chain in a PCU.
       pcarsp - [P] Runs the tools necessary to construct response matrices 
                for XTE PCA spectral data. 
      perdgrm - Computes a periodgram for unevenly sampled light curves.
      rddescr - Parses a channel descriptor from an XTE .pha file to ASCII.
      recofmi - Reconstructs a FMI (master index) file for an XTE database.
runpcabackest - [P] Runs PCABACKEST on a series of StdMode2 data files. 
       saexpd - Reads science array vectors and outputs generic FITS files.
     saextrct - Creates lightcurve and/or spectrum from science array vectors.
    sebitmask - Creates bitmask for filtering SE data with FSELECT.
       seexpd - Reads science events data and outputs generic FITS files.
     seextrct - Creates lightcurve and/or spectrum from science events data.
       sachip - [P] Runs SAEXTRCT and FPLOT once from command line. 
       saplot - [P] Cyclically queries the user for additional SA files and
                then runs SAEXTRCT and FPLOT, for SOF. 
     sefilter - [P] Helps the user generate an expression that is fed into 
                SEBITMASK and examines the result to determine if the file 
                can be directly input into SEEXTRCT for filtering, or if it 
                first needs to be input to FSELECT. 
       seplot - [P] Cyclically queries the user for additional SE files and
                then runs SEEXTRCT and FPLOT, for SOF.
