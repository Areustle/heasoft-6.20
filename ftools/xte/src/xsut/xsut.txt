NAME
    xsut -- Xte Selective UnTar
    
    
USAGE
    xsut
    
    
DESCRIPTION

    XSUT is a tool designed by the RXTE GOF as a graphical front-end to
    the GNU tar program to help in selectively untarring RXTE data
    tapes or tar files (eg, resulting from downloading archived data).
    Note that it is NOT a general untarring GUI; it is specifically
    designed to handle the particular obsid/appid layout of RXTE data
    trees. It is most useful in those cases when one does not
    necessarily want to unpack the entire tape or archive file, for
    example because of disk space constraints. If disk space is not an
    issue one will almost certainly find it faster to simply untar the
    whole tape and then delete the unneeded portions, since XSUT must
    first scan the entire tape or archive file before doing anything
    else.

    You can invoke xsut by simply typing 'xsut' at your command prompt.
    More information is available as online help by clicking with your
    mouse on the "Help" button visible in the GUI.

PARAMETERS

BUGS
