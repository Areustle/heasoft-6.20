NAME
    sbmerge  --  Combine concurrent single-bit (SB) mode data and create
    an output file of Science Array format which can be used with saextrct.
    
    
USAGE
    sbmerge num_file infile outfile
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task takes several SB mode data or an ASCII file that  contains
    the  list of SB mode data as input.  It will generate an output file
    of Science Array (SA) format.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    num_file [integer - number of input files]
        This number can be  number  of  SB  mode  data  files  be  input
        interactively,  or  number  of  SB  mode data file listed in the
        input ascii file. The maximum number is 10.
    
    infile [string - file name(s)]
        This can be SB mode data file names being  input  interactively,
        or  the  name  of an ascii file that lists the SB mode data.  In
        the latter case, the filename must be preceded with "@"  and  in
        the file each data file name should occupy one line.
    
    outfile [string - file name]
        The name of output file.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.  Combine 3 SB mode data files using a list file as input.
    sbmerge num_file=3 infile=@listfile outfile=ofilename
