NAME
    recofmi -- Reconstruct an FMI from subdirectories'  FMIs  which  may
    be  nested  one  level  or  two  levels  deep  (determined  by level
    parameter).
    
    
USAGE
    recofmi dirpath level delete overwrite check debug
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    Reconstruct an FMI from subdirectories' FMIs  which  may  be  nested
    one level or two levels deep (determined by level parameter).
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    dirpath [string]
        Directory path where the FMI file to be fixed can be found.
    
    (level = 1) [integer]
        Nesting level for sub-FMIs; may be 1 or 2; default: 1.
    
    (delete = no) [boolean]
        Delete all rows in the FMI before reconstructing it; default: no
    
    (overwrite = no) [boolean]
        Allow existing rows in FMI to be overwritten; default: no
    
    (check = no) [boolean]
        Check FMI consistency; default: no.
    
    (debug = no) [boolean]

    (mode = ql) [string]

EXAMPLES
    1. Reconstruct a proposal level FMI from obsid level FMIs
    
    recofmi /data/xte/P00013
    
    
    
NOTES:
    The  tool  now corrects any FMI it encounters which doesn't properly
    increment the StopDate column when  an  observation  crosses  a  day
    boundary.
