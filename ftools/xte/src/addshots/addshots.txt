NAME
    addshots -- add shot noise to an input light curve
    
    
USAGE
    addshots  infile  outfile  intervals  rate  amplitude duration shape
    noise
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This task adds a shot noise light curve to  an  input  binned  light
    curve.   The user specifies the shot shape, amplitude, duration, and
    rate.  The user  also  specifies  a  noise  option.   The  currently
    supported   shot   shapes   are   square,   exponential  decay,  and 
    exponential decay with a sinusoidal modulation.  The user  may  also
    specify  a  distribution  of  shot durations to give a f^delta power
    law in the power density spectrum.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [file name]
        The name of the input FITS file.  A file conforming to the  OGIP
        Timing  FITS  file format is expected.  If no TIME column exists
        in the input file, the routine constructs  the  times  from  the
        TIMEZERI,  TIMEZERF and TIMEDEL keywords.  If the TIME column is
        present, then a shot light curve will be  added  to  every  time
        bin falling within the specified time intervals.
    
    outfile [file name]
        The  name  of  the  output FITS format.  The format of this file
        follows the OGIP Timing FITS File  Format.   Keywords  from  the
        input file are copied to the output file.
    
    intervals [string]
        The  time  interval(s)  within  which to add a shot light curve.
        The time unit is the same as that  of  the  input  light  curve.
        These  intervals  are  listed  as pairs of start and stop times.
        To default to all the data in the file, use -.   To  default  an
        interval  to the beginning or end of the data, omit the start or
        stop  time  e.g.,  -35622.0,  or  45329.0-  .   Up  to  15  time 
        intervals  may  be  specified.  Results from different intervals
        are output to different extensions.
    
    rate [double precision real]
        The shot rate, in number / s.
    
    shape = SQUARE, EXPON or EXPSIN [string]
        The shot shape.  Currently the following profiles are  provided:
        flat-top    (SQUARE),   exponentially   decaying   (EXPON),   or  
        exponential decay with a sinusoidal modulation (EXPSIN).
    
    amplitude [real]
        The shot amplitude, in counts/s.
    
    duration [double precision real]
        The shot duration, in seconds.   For  EXPON  and  EXPSIN  shots,
        this  is the exponential decay constant; for SQUARE shots, it is
        the total duration.
    
    noise [integer]
        The noise option to be used in producing the shot  light  curve.
        The  integer  values have the following meanings:  0 = no noise;
        1 = Poisson noise; 2 = Gaussian noise.  The  Poisson  statistics
        are  governed  by the intensity as expressed in counts.  (If the
        input intensity is in COUNT/S, the conversion to COUNTS is  done
        internally   using   the   bin  size.)   If  Gaussian  noise  is 
        specified, the sigma for the Gaussian distribution is  specified
        using  the  SIGMA parameter.  If the input file does not have an
        ERROR column, ADDSHOTS assumes the  input  data  is  noise-less.
        Adding  a  noise  shot  light  curve  to a noise-less input will
        result in the creation of an ERROR column  in  the  output  FITS
        file.   If  Poisson  nose  is  specified,  the ERROR is computed
        using Poisson statistics on the total counts  (input  +  shots).
        If  Gaussian  noise  is specified, the sigma inputted is applied
        only to the shot light curve.
    
    (sigma) [real]
        The sigma to be used for the Gaussian noise.
    
    (epsilon = 0) [real]
        For a distribution of shot durations, the minimum duration.
    
    (zeta = 0) [real]
        For a distribution of shot durations, the maximum duration.
    
    (delta = 0) [real]
        For a distribution of shot durations, the desired power law  for
        the  resulting  power density spectrum.  Note that -2 .le. delta
        .le. 0.
    
    (alpha = 0) [real]
        The exponent for a power law dependence of the amplitude on  the
        duration.   Note that alpha must be negative, and the dependence
        takes the form of   amp = amp * (duration/bin)^(alpha/2)
    
    (amod = 0) [real]
        The amplitude  for  the  sinusoidal  modulation  in  the  EXPSIN
        profile.   Note that shots having only positive intensity result
        when amod < amp.  When amod > amp, the shot profile  itself  may
        contain negative intensity values.
    
    (period = 0) [double precision]
        The period for the sinusoidal modulation in the EXPSIN profile.
    
    (psig = 0) [double precision]
        The  sigma  for  the  deviation  in the period of the sinusoidal
        modulation  in  the  EXPSIN  profile.   Specific   periods   are 
        generated from a gaussian distribution based on period and psig.
    
    (seed = -3971) [integer]
        Initial  seed  for  the random number generator.  Note that this
        must be a negative integer.
    
    (timename = TIME) [string]
        Name of the time column to be used.  If no time  column  exists,
        then  times will be constructed based on the time bin size given
        in the header.
    
    (ratename = RATE) [string]
        Name of the intensity column to be added to.   If  ratename  not
        found in the input file, execution ceases.
    
    (errname = ERROR) [string]
        Name  of  the  column  containing the uncertainty values for the
        intensity column.  If errname  not  found,  the  input  data  is
        assumed to be noiseless.
    
    (copyprime = yes) [boolean]
        Whether  to  copy  the  primary  header and array to the output.
        (The "no" option is not supported.)
    
    (copyall = no) [boolean]
        Whether to copy all other extension in the  input  file  to  the
        output file.  (The "yes" option is not supported.)
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1.  Add shot noise comprised of exponentially decaying shots to an
    input light curve.  The shots have an amplitude of 10 count/s, a
    decay time of 2.5 seconds, and have no noise added.
    The shot rate is 5 shots per second
    
    addshots infile=test.lc outfile=shottest.lc intervals=- rate=5.
    amplitude= 10. duration=2.5 shape=EXPON noise=0 
    
    2.  Add shot noise to the first part of the input light curve.  Use
    square shots, with an amplitude of 0.1 count/s, a duration of 235
    seconds, a shot rate of 0.05 shots/s, and poisson noise added with 
    the shot light curve.
    
    addshots infile=test2.lc outfile=shottest2.lc intervals=-49000.45
    rate=0.05 amplitude= 0.1 duration=235. shape=SQUARE noise=1
