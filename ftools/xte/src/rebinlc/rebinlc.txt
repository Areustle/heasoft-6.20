NAME
    rebinlc -- Simple tool to rebin OGIP-compliant lightcurves
    
    
USAGE
    rebinlc infile multiple outfile columns clobber
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [string - input file name]
        The name (and optionally, extension number) of  the  input  FITS
        file containing the lightcurve to be rebinned.
    
    multiple = 1 [integer - rebinning factor]
        An (integer) multiplier which controls the rebinning. The output
        FITS lightcurve will have a TIMEDEL equal to the TIMEDEL of  the
        input lightcurve multiplied by this factor.
    
    outfile [string - output file name]
        Name for the output file containing the rebinned lightcurve.
    
    (columns = -) [string - column names]
        Intended  to  contain  the  names of the relevant columns in the
        lightcurve extension. NOT YET OPERATIONAL. The tool expects,  by
        default,  to find either RATE, COUNTS, or FLUX, depending on the
        lightcurve type (specified by the HDUCLAS3 keyword), along  with
        and ERROR and FRACEXP column.
    
    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        Should an existing file having the same name be overwritten?
    
    (mode = ql) [string]
        FTOOLS internal -- users should not need to change.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    
    
NOTES:
    This tool will (hopefully) someday be completely generic but for now
    it is fairly rigid about the column names it  expects  depending  on
    the  HDUCLAS3 keyword. It was designed specifically for rebinning of
    HEXTE lightcurves to allow for background  subtraction  to  be  done
    properly  and  is  used  in  this way by the REX script. However, it
    should work properly on  any  OGIP-compliant  lightcurve  containing
    either   RATE/COUNTS/FLUX  columns  along  with  ERROR  and  FRACEXP 
    columns.
