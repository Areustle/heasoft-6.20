                             XTE Data Finder
                             ===============

NAME
    xdf -- The GUI XTE data finder
    
    
USAGE
    xdf
    
    
DESCRIPTION

    XDF is a tool to navigate the XTE FITS Database (XFDB).  Its
    purpose is to select FITS data tables based on selection criteria
    provided by the user.

    The user interface consists of six 'Selection Boxes', one text
    widget, and various action buttons.


  Selection Boxes
  ---------------

    All boxes contain four or five buttons that operate on them:

       Help:  Pop up help window for Selection Box.
       All:   Select all items in the Selection Box.
       None:  De-select all items in the Selection Box.
       Reset: Reset contents of Selection Box to default value.
       Edit:  (for some) Edit the contents of the Selection Box.

    The boxes are:

       1. Source List
          >>Created by the user.

          Allows the user to specify particular source names.
          Wildcard characters are accepted.  No selection means 'no
          constraints'.

       2. Time Range List
          >>Created by the user.

          The user may specify certain time ranges in the format:
              yyyyMMMdd at hh:mm:ss.s to yyyyMMMdd at hh:mm:ss.s
          For instance:
              1995Apr07 at 12:00:00 to 1995JUN30 at 22:23:24
          No selection means 'no constraints'.

       3. Subsystem List
          >>User selects from a fixed list.

          Allows the user to select one or more from the list of 15
          XTE subsystems. No selection means 'all'.

       4. Observation List
          >>Created by action button.

          Observations are selected from the database on the basis of
          the selection criteria currently set by the Source List and
          the Time Range List. The user _has_ to select one or more
          items from this list.

       5. AppId/Configuration List
          >>Created by action button.

          AppIds (spacecraft data sources) and, for the science data,
          data modes and configurations are selected from the database
          on the basis of the selection criteria currently set by the
          Observation List and the Subsystem List.  The user _has_ to
          select one or more items from this list.

       6. FITS File List
          >>Created by action button.

          FITS data table files are selected from the database on the
          basis of the selection criteria currently set by the
          Observation List, the Subsystem List, the
          AppId/Configuration List, and the Time Range List.  Files
          may be selected and their names saved in the file
          ./fits_files.xdf.  If none are selected, the Save FileList
          action will save all names in the list.  This is, at the
          moment, the end product of XDF.


  Directions for Use

    5. Select observations.

    6. Set subsystem selection (if any).

    7. Press action button to make AppId/Configuration List

    8. Select AppId/Configuration combinations.

    9. Adjust observation, time range, subsystem selection, if
       desired.  Only additional restrictions will have effect!
