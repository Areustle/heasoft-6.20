                           XDF - version 2.03
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Overview

   The XTE Data Finder (XDF) is an tool for navigating the XTE FITS
   Database (XFDB) that has an X-Windows based graphical user interface.
   XDF allows the user to enter source names, time ranges, and select
   subsystem constraints interactively, searching for observations,
   application IDs, and instrument configurations that fit those
   constraints.  The final product is a list of FITS files from the XFDB
   which can be saved to a plain ASCII file for subsequent use by Ftools
   or the user's favorite analysis tools.

   XDF is implemented using Tcl and Tk as well as the object-oriented
   extensions to Tcl, known as iTcl.  XTE-specific Tcl commands have
   been implemented using C and the new C-based version of the
   FITS I/O library.

   Versions 1.* were implemented using Tcl version 7.3, iTcl version
   1.5, and Tk version 3.6 and developed under SunOS 4.1.3.  It was also
   implemented using FITSIO version 3.71.

   Version 2.03 of XDF is implemented using Tcl 7.4, Tk 4.0, and CFITSIO
   0.95, all of which involve significant departures from and
   incompatibilities with their predecessors.

   XDF consists of,

      xtcl_wish: a version of the object-oriented itcl_wish interpreter
      extended to include the XTE-specific commands, SelectObs, 
      SelectAppIds, and SelectFiles

      xTcl/iTcl widgets: XdfBox as derived from the FilterBox widget
      class distributed with iTcl 1.5, the unaltered iTcl 1.5 widget classes
      ListBox and SelectBox, and a Tcl autoload index file, tclIndex,
      appropriate for XDF

      .xdfrc: the xtcl_wish script used to drive XDF

      xdf: a Bourne shell script that searches first in the current
      working directory for .xdfrc, then the user's $HOME directory, and
      finally in the "installed" XDF directory, then executes xtcl_wish
      using the first .xdfrc it finds as a driver script


2) Obtaining XDF and Preparing for Installation

   All XDF source components and a few binaries are included in a
   tar file xdf2.03.tar.gz that is available by anonymous ftp from
   xpert.stx.com in the directory pub/soc/fits/src.

   Other SunOS sites may be able to use the "static" SunOS 4.1.3
   executable, xtcl_wish, included in the distribution of XDF 2.0 (see
   #4 below).  An Alpha (OSF3.0) binary is also included.

   However, to create XDF 2.0 from source, the following software must
   be installed on the target system:

      - Tcl 7.4		(ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl)
      - Tk 4.0		(ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl)
      - iTcl 1.5	(ftp://ftp.aud.alcatel.com/tcl/extensions)
      - CFITSIO 0.95	(ftp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/software/fitsio/

   All of the above software can also be obtained from ftp@xpert.stx.com
   in the directory pub/soc/fits/src.

   This is provided as a service only.  When you install xdf, it will be
   assumed that the above packages are installed already.  Unless you
   feel comfortable with installing such software, we strongly recommend
   that you check with your system administrator first.

   For more information on Tcl/Tk and CFITSIO, see the web pages:

3) Users in the XTE/GOF Environment
   
   Those users with access to the XTE/GOF /data/osiris* directories
   should disregard the remainder of this document and merely define
   the following pathname in their execution search path:

	/data/osiris01/xtegof/local/bin

   Then to execute XDF, just type:

	xdf

   NOTE: care should be taken to un-define any alias command for "xdf" (as
   was required for pre-2.0 releases of XDF) that might exist in the user's
   environment and/or login scripts.


4) Using a Distributed xtcl_wish Binary

   (Skip this section and go to #5 if you are building XDF from source.)

   Other Sun sites may be able to use the binary executable xtcl_wish.SunOS4;
   Alpha sites the executable xtcl_wish.Alpha.  These are included in the
   distribution of XDF 2.0.  The advantage is that installation of itcl and
   CFITSIO are not required.  It does assume, though, that Tcl 7.4 and Tk 4.0
   are already installed, or at least their "library" directories are
   otherwise available.  All the required iTcl 1.5 widget classes and
   associated tclIndex file are distributed with XDF 2.0.

   It is *IMPERATIVE*, however, that the environment variables
   TCL_LIBRARY and TK_LIBRARY be correctly defined as the pathnames to
   the Tcl 7.4 and Tk 4.0 library directories, respectively.

   That is,

	a. Set the environment variable TCL_LIBRARY as the path to the
           local Tcl 7.4 library directory, e.g.,

	   setenv TCL_LIBRARY /usr/local/lib/tcl

	b. Set the environment variable TK_LIBRARY as the path to the
           local Tk 4.0 library directory, e.g.,

	   setenv TK_LIBRARY /usr/local/lib/tk

   Skip the next section and go to #6.


5) Generating XDF from Source

   Generating XDF from source requires that the tcl 7.4, itcl 1.5, tk 4.0,
   and CFITSIO 0.95 be installed first.  When that is the case:

	a. Edit the Makefile to personalize it for your own site.
	   This will usually involve three types of changes:
		The installation directories (prefix and exec-prefix)
		The locations of include and library directories
		Platform and installation dependent libraries (LOCAL_LIBS)
	   They appear in that order at the beginnig of the Makefile.

	b. Type "make"

   If the make succeeds, you may want to test XDF before installing it.
   To do so, simply type "xdf".


6) Installing XDF

   Some editing of the .xdfrc xtcl_wish script is  required, in order to
   correctly define the path to the iTcl widget library used by the Tcl
   auto loader.  You can also redefine the default path to the FITS
   Master Index file of the XFDB, although this can always be overridden
   in XDF using the "Path" entry window.

	a. Edit .xdfrc and define the correct path to the xtcl/iTcl
	   widget library to be used by the Tcl auto loader, e.g.,

  	   set xTcl_widgets /usr/local/lib/xtcl/widgets

	   NOTE: The installation of iTcl 1.5 does not include
	   installing the (demo) iTcl widgets, so the user/installer
	   of XDF will have to chose a home for these.

	   Optionally, edit the directory path to a default FITS Master
	   Index, e.g.,

	   set default_path "/data/osiris02/xtegof/FITS/FD"

	b. edit the script file "xdf" and define INSTALLED_XDF_SCRIPT

   To install XDF, you must, of course, have permission to install it in
   the target directories.  If so, simply type "make install".
