NAME
    edsgcor -- Converts the PCA/EDS Gain & Offset  file  from  ASCII  to
    FITS format
    
    
USAGE
    edsgcor corfil date time
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  converts  the PCA/EDS Gain & Offset file provided by the
    PCA team from its native ASCII format to FITS format.   In  addition
    to  the  ascii file, the user also inputs the date and time at which
    the values take effect.  The routine  writes  the  appropriate  OGIP
    Calibration  Keywords  into the header, and also copies into COMMENT
    keywords the entire header of the input file.  The  output  file  is
    given  the  name "edsgcor_<yymmdd>.fits".  This task is intended for
    the sole use by the XTE SOC and/or PCA team.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    corfil [string]
        The name of the ascii PCA/EDS Gain & Offset file.
    
    date (yymmdd) [string]
        The date on which the values take effect.
    
    time (hhmmss) [string]
        The time at which the values take effect.
    
    
EXAMPLES
    1. edsgcor corfil=edsgain.dat date=960215 time=001234
    
    Create a fits file containing the gain and offset values from the file
    edsgain.dat.  The data take effect at 00:12:34 on Feb 15, 1996.  The
    fits output file will have the name edsgcor_960215.fits
