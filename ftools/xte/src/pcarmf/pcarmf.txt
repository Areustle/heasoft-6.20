NAME
    pcarmf -- creates a .rmf file for an  specified  anode  chain  (i.e.
    combination of layers) in a given pcu
    
    
USAGE
    pcarmf outfile pcuid lld_code cdate chatter
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  task  creates  a response matrix for a particular pcu with 900
    energy channels and 256 pulse height  channels.   Half  of  the  900
    channels  are between 0 and 10 keV;  half are between 10 and 70 keV.
    Channels are equally spaced within these ranges except that  channel
    boundaries  are  created  at  Xenon  photoelectrc  absorption edges.
    Future versions may need more channels around the K edge.  The  user
    specifies  the  desired  pcu, anode chain, the name of the energy to
    channel conversion file, and the date of the obsevation.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    outfile [file name]
        The name of the output .rmf file.
    
    pcuid [integer]
        The desired pcu.  Note that the pcu's are numbered from 0 to 4.
    
    lld_code [integer]
        The desired lld code.  The valid values are: (1, 2,  3)  =  (L1,
        R1,  L1+R1),  (4,  8, 12) = (L2, R2, L2+R2), (16, 32, 48) = (L3,
        R3, L3+R3), 63 = all xenon  layers,  64  =  propane  layer.   In
        addition,  users  may  specify  the  "back" layers, L2+R2+L3+R3,
        using a value of 60.
    
    (e2c_model = 3) [integer]
        The energy to channel model.  The only model supported  by  this
        version  is  3,  which first translates the energy of the photon
        into the number  of  secondary  electrons,  and  then  allows  a
        quadratic  fit  for  channel  number  as a function of number of
        electrons.  The x-axis (number of electrons) is renormalized  to
        be  approximately the energy for convenience for plotting inside
        xspec.
    
    (e2cfile = "caldb") [file name]
        The  name  of  the  file  containing  the  channel   to   energy 
        parameters.    If  e2cfile  =  CALDB,  PCARMF  will  search  the 
        calibration data base for the appropriate file, based on  values
        of  pcuid,  lld,  e2c_model,  and  date.   Any  other  string is
        interpretted as a FITS  file  in  the  local  directory,  unless
        nofits is set to 1.
    
    (nofits = 0) [integer]
        If  this  flag is 1, then c2efile is interpretted as the name of
        a local ascii file with the  parameters  of  channel  to  energy
        conversion.  For expert use only.
    
    (scale_hack = 0) [integer]
        If  this  flag  is  1,  then  a  fudge  factor is applied to the
        response  matrix  which  forces  the  fit  to  the  Crab  for  a 
        particular  layer/detector  to  be  the same as that obtained by
        including all the layers and detectors.  For expert use only.
    
    (scale_file = "none") [file name]
        If scale_hack = 1, this local ascii file is assumed  to  contain
        the  efficiency  corrections.   In  absence  of  this  file,  no 
        correction is done.  The file must contain 25  rows,  each  with
        an  energy and correction value.  Efficiencies at energies below
        the lowest  tabulated  value  will  not  be  changed,  nor  will
        efficiencies   above   the   highest   tabulated   value.    For  
        intermediate energies, the  efficency  correction  is  a  linear
        interpolation  between  the nearest tabulated points.  Note that
        the energies must increase monotonically.  For expert use only.
    
    cdate [string]
        The date of the observation, in the form yyyy-mm-dd.
    
    chatter [integer]
        Chatter  parameter  controlling  how  much  to  tell  the  user. 
        Larger values give more information.
    
    (clobber = yes) [string]
        Delete output file if it exists? (override with !filename)

    (xe_ledge_veto = 0.91) [real*4]
        Non-self veto fraction above the L3-edge.
    
    (xeKedge = 34.561) [real*4]

    (xeL3edge = 4.782) [real*4]  
        Xenon L3 absorption edge in keV.
    
    (xeL2edge = 5.104)

    (EscFracKb = 0.3) [real*4]
        The  fraction  of  events  above  the  Xenon  K-edge  which  are 
        detected in the  Xenon  K-Beta  escape  peak.   Version  1.0  of
        PCARMF   treats   this  fraction  as  independent  of  LLD,  and 
        independent of energy.  Brookhaven data suggest that this  ratio
        may vary by ~ 10 % as energy varies from 34-60 keV
    
    (EscEnerKb = 33.62) [real*4]  
        The offset in keV of the Xenon K-Beta escape peak.
    
    (EscFracKa = 0.39) [real*4]
        The  fraction  of  events  above  the  Xenon  K-edge  which  are 
        detected in the Xenon  K-Alpha  escape  peak.   Version  1.0  of
        PCARMF   treats   this  fraction  as  independent  of  LLD,  and 
        independent of  energy.   Brookhaven  data  suggest  that  these
        assumptions are justified.
    
    (EscEnerKa = 29.70) [real*4]  
        The offset in keV of the Xenon K-Alpha escape peak.
    
    (EscFracL1 = 0.000) [real*4]

    (DeltaE_L3 = 0.085) (DeltaE_L2 = 0.032) (DeltaE_L1 = 0.012) (DeltaE_K = 0.180)
        The  offset,  in  keV,  in the channel to energy law observed at
        the Xenon edges.  The default values are  from  the  literature.
        The  values that are reported to XSPEC as the channel boundaries
        are not always strictly adjacent; this is necessary for  display
        purposes  in energy space, but causes some gaps for some display
        options.  The calculation  is  believed  to  get  the  effective
        channel width correctly.

        0 and 1.

        for each detector. As of v11.7 release (July 2009) only valid for PCUs 
        0 and 1.
    
    (cdate1_<n>) [real*4]
        Second reference date for xenon in propane layer. For PCUs 0 and 1 
        is effectively a date of the propane layer loss. For other PCUs not
        valid (as of July 2009).
