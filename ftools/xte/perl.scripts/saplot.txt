NAME
    saplot -- a script that queries the user for  all  required  input
    and runs in sucession SAEXTRCT and FPLOT. 
    
    
USAGE
    saplot 
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This script file is meant to allow the user to add files for filtering on 
    the fly and then plot the results. In this way the user can add files to
    be processed on the fly and see the results of each additional file added.
    After the first run all previous answers are carried through for each 
    subsequent iteration. 

    This script file will ask the user if he wants full filtering capability.
If the user answers YES than ALL of the required parameters for SAEXTRCT will
be asked for. If the user answers NO than only the absolutely necessary 
parameters will be asked for. 
    The script will (if there is more than one possiblity) ask the user if 
the lightcurve or the spectra is to be plotted. The user will be able to 
interact with FPLOT interactively at the PLT> command option.
