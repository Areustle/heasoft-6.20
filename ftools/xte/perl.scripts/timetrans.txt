NAME
    timetrans -- a script that queries the user for a series of relative 
time values (beginning at 0) and translates them into their absolute 
time values and store that into a file ready for input into SA(E)EXTRCT. 
    
    
USAGE
    timetrans -i "infile" -f "outfile" -t "Relative time ranges or @filename" -h (help)
or  timetrans
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This script file is meant to allow the user to specify an input file,
and output file, and a series of relative time ranges (i.e., 0-250.0,
350.0-500.0, 750.0-1000.0) and the script will read the TIMEZERO, and 
TSTART keywords from the input file and translate the specified relative time 
ranges to their absolute times ranges and these values would be input 
into SA(E)EXTRCT as the "timeint" value, via the @filename option. The 
time ranges MUST have a DASH (-) between start and stop times, and a
comma separating each range from the next range, as well as a decimal
point followed by a 0 or some other value if given on the input line. If 
they are supplied via the @filename option each time-range must be on 
its own line with dashes separating the start and stop times. (See below 
for more information.)
    
PARAMETERS (SWITCHES/FLAGS)

    -i {file} - provide name of the spectral file input to FPLOT.

    -f {file} - provide the name of an output file to contain the absolute
                time range.

    -t {Relative time range} - Give a relative time range in the form of
		"0.0-250.0,350.0-500.0, 750.0-1000.0" (Note that 
                these values can be read off of an FPLOT image of the 
	        light-curve.) The timerange can also accept an input file
		via @filename, but the input MUST have the form:
		    0.0-250.0
		    350.0-500.0
		    750.0-1000.0
		i.e., each range must be on a separate line, with a "-"
		separating them, and the last line MUST be a blank line.

EXAMPLES
    1. timetrans -i "sac.pha" -f "timeint.tint" -t "0-250.0,
            350.0-500.0, 750.0-1000.0"
    2. timetrans -i "sac.pha" -f "timeint.tint" -t "@filename"
    3. timetrans
