NAME
    runpcabackest -- a script that queries the user for all required input
    and pcabackest upon a series of input files, the names of the output
    files are written to a file ready to be input into saextrct. The code 
    queries the user if it should call saextrct. 
    
USAGE
    runpcabackest  
    
DESCRIPTION
    This code basically allows PCABACKEST to be run upon a series of
 Standard Mode 2 XTE data files, input via a @filename, where filename
 contains the names of the files to operate upon. PCABACKEST is then 
 called successively to  create a series of output files which have the
 same name as the input file with _outsuffix appended to the name. These 
 output files are then ready to be processed by SAEXTRCT. The names of the
 output files are written to a file and are ready to be input into SAEXTRCT
 via the @filename option.
