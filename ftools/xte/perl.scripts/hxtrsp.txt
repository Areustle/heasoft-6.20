	HXTRSP 3.2
 
NAME
	hxtrsp - produce a HEXTE response matrix for a HEXTE spectrum (PHA file)

USAGE
	hxtrsp [-i "pha_file"] [-a "attitude_file"] [-h]

If the "pha_file" or "attitude_file" are not present, the user is prompted for
them.

DESCRIPTION
	This is a Perl script. 

For a HEXTE spectrum it uses the calibration data stored in the OGIP
Calibration Database ("CALDB") to form an appropriate response matrix, based
on the "detector ID" of the spectrum, the observation date, and an optional
XTE Filter file or attitude file for calculating the collimator response.
(If not provided, the Ftool HXTARF is called in any case to calculate the
collimator response at the nominal RXTE boresight).

The resulting response matrix is named after the root name of the PHA file
with the suffix ".rsp". 

If the detector ID and date/time are not present in the PHA file as FITS
keywords, the user is prompted for their values (which are subsequently
written into the PHA file, along with a RESPFILE keyword identifying
the new response matrix which HXTRSP created). 

PARAMETERS
	 -i pha_file:
A spectral file produced by SEEXTRCT/SAEXTRCT, optionally corrected for
dead-time by HXTDEAD.

	 -a attitude_file:
An RXTE attitude file (FH0e_*), or an RXTE filter file containing spacecraft
attitude data for the observation. Either file must contain data covering
the start and stop times of the PHA file. If the user specifies 'NONE', then
HXTARF assumes that the observation was made at the RXTE nominal boresight
position; type "fhelp hxtarf" for more details.

Ftools called by this script:
-----------------------------
quzcif, fkeypar, pget, rddescr, rbnrmf, hxtarf, marfrmf, fparkey

CALDB datasets required: 
------------------------
"MATRIX", "COLLRESP", "EFF_AREA" datasets are all required to be defined for
the HEXTE, the last two are for use with HXTARF.

EXAMPLES
	1. hxtrsp -i FS50_xxx.pha -a xtefilt.xfl
This produces a HEXTE matrix called FS50_xxx.rsp suitable for the PHA file.
An RXTE filter file is used for the spacecraft pointing data, which is
compared to the RA_OBJ and DEC_OBJ keywords in the input PHA file.

	2. hxtrsp -a NONE
The user has specified that no spacecraft pointing data be used. HXTRSP
will prompt for the name of the input PHA file.

	3. hxtrsp -h | more
Prints this help information.
