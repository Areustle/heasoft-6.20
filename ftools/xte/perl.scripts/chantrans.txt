NAME
    chantrans -- a script that queries the user for a series of relative 
channel values (beginning at 0) and translates them into their absolute 
channel values and store that into a file ready for input into SA(E)EXTRCT. 
    
    
USAGE
    chantrans -i "infile" -f "outfile" -c "Relative channel ranges" -h (help) -p (print out all channel information) or chantrans
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This script file is meant to allow the user to specify an input file,
and output file, and a series of relative channel ranges (i.e., 0-16, 22,
28-50) and the script will read the CPIX keyword from the infile translate 
the specified relative channel ranges to their absolute channels ranges 
(e.g., given CPIXn = (0:22),(23~29), (30:51;2), (52:255), the output file 
would contain 0-16, 22, 32-64) and this value would be input in SA(E)EXTRCT 
as the "chint" value. 
    
PARAMETERS (SWITCHES/FLAGS)

    -i {file} - provide name of the spectral file input to FPLOT.

    -f {file} - provide the name of an output file to contain the absolute
                channel range.

    -c {Relative channel range} - Give a relative channel range in the form of
		"0-5, 16, 17-22, 50-128" (Note that these values can
	        be read off of an FPLOT image of the spectrum).

    -p       - Print out relationship between relative channels and absolute 
               channels. 
    
EXAMPLES
    1. chantrans -i "sac.pha" -f "chint.out" -c "0-16, 22, 28-50"
    2. chantrans
