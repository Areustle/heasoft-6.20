NAME
	gti2xronwin -- a script that converts a GTI file (or extension) to
a XRONOS-format time filter file, i.e., *.wi file.

USAGE
	gti2xronwin  (user will be prompted for input and output filenames)

   or

        gti2xronwin -c -i my_gtifile.fits -o my_xronwin_file

DESCRIPTION

PARAMETERS (SWITCHES/FLAGS)

  -c [clobber]     Use this switch to allow the tool to clobber an existing
                    output file with the same name.

  -i [input file]  This flag must be followed by the name of the input
                    FITS file to use. Unless an extension number is specified
                    the tool will examine the header units in the input file
                    in turn until it finds a valid GTI extension to operate upon.
 
  -o [output file] This flag is used to specify the name of the output file.
