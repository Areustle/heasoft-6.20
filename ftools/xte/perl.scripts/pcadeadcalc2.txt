NAME
    pcadeadcalc2 - Calculate deadtime for PCA Standard2 file (or background)

USAGE
    Standard2:  pcadeadcalc2 std2file std2file_DT hkfiles=@hkfiles.lis
    Background: pcadeadcalc2 bkgfile  bkgfile_DT  std2file=std2file_DT

DESCRIPTION

    pcadeadcalc2 calculates PCA deadtime quantities for data in the
    Standard2 mode.  This tool calculates the dead time due to various
    terms, including GoodXenon counts, Very Large Event (VLE) counts,
    Propane layer counts, and other counts in the detector.  Also, by
    default, the tool filters out bad data during times which are
    known to be "bad" for typical scientific analysis.

    This tool is designed to function for both Standard2 files and
    also for background files created with pcabackest.  The tool is
    run in a slightly different way for each, described below.

    As output, the tool produces a "new" Standard2 or background file
    which contain dead-time related quantities appended as new columns
    to the table.  The user can use these quantities to adjust their
    light curves or spectra to remove the effects of dead-time.

    pcadeadcalc2 does not apply any deadtime correction by itself, but
    merely calculates dead-time related quantities, and (optionally)
    filters out PCU data during known bad states.  See 'pcadeadspect2'
    for more information about to correct Standard2 spectra.

    The most useful columns in the FITS table are:
        LiveTimePcu0
        LiveTimePcu1
        LiveTimePcu2
        LiveTimePcu3
        LiveTimePcu4
    which represent the detector live-time for each PCU in the PCA array,
    I.e. the number of effective seconds each PCU was sensitive to X-rays
    during each 16-second counting interval.  When a PCU's high voltage is
    disabled, the detector is considered "dead".

    Other useful quantities in the output file are:
        PCUN_ON       - is PCU N enabled?
        DeadTimePcuN  - [sec] effective dead-time for PCU N
        LiveFracPcuN  - fractional live-time for PCU N
        BadPcuN       - PCU N is OFF or in a known bad state

BAD SCIENCE TIMES

    By default, zero_bad=YES, which instructs pcadeadcalc2 to filter
    out data from PCUs which are in a known "bad" state for scientific
    analysis.  It does this by setting the Xenon counts to zero during
    these times, as well as OnTime = LiveTime = 0.  This setting
    occurs on a PCU-by-PCU basis.

    pcadeadcalc2 has a list of known conditions which would flag a PCU
    as "bad" for scientific analysis.  The tool's categorization does
    not mean that such data cannot be analyzed, but it does mean that
    typically a scientist would not analyze these data, but even if
    they did, it would require special care.  The conditions also
    represent the RXTE PCA team's best recommendations for data
    filtering for generic observations and typical scientific
    analysis.  The conditions for declaring a "bad time" are:

      1. A PCU's high voltage is disabled.
      2. A PCU's high voltage transition occurred in the previous or
         next Standard2 sample. (disable with transition_bad=NO)
      3. A PCU breakdown event occurred between TIME-600 and TIME+150.
         (only if breakfile is set)
      4. PCU0 is missing its propane layer (i.e., after 2000-05-20).
         (disable with propane_bad=NO)
      5. PCU1 is missing its propane layer (i.e., after 2006-12-25).
         (disable with propane_bad=NO)

    Most of these conditions can be disabled, as indicated in the list.
    

BREAKDOWNS

    PCA breakdown events can create subtle effects even before the
    high voltage is turned off.  The user is strongly recommended to
    download a up-to-date version of the RXTE calibration database
    (CALDB) and set breakfile=CALDB, which is the default.  This will
    automatically flag breakdown events as "bad" times on an
    individual PCU-by-PCU basis.


HOW TO RUN

    Standard2 files (files beginning with "FS4a"), contain various
    counting rates and spectra that are used for science.  The user
    must provide as input the name of the Standard2 file and the names
    of the PCA housekeeping files via the 'hkfiles' parameter (i.e.,
    files beginning with "FH5a,b,c,d,e").

    Background files are produced by the task 'pcabackest' or
    'runpcabackest' and represent an estimated background which
    exactly corresponds to a Standard2 file in the same observation.
    Background estimates do not have many of the rates required to
    compute the deadtime, so the user must first run 'pcadeadcalc2' on
    the corresponding Standard2 file, and then use the output of that
    as input via the 'std2file' parameter.

    Let us assume that following files are present:
         FS4a     - Standard2 data
         FS4a_bkg - Background estimates (from pcabackest)
    and we wish to calculate deadtime quantities    
         FS4a_DT     - Standard2 *PLUS* deadtime quantities
         FS4a_bkgDT - Background estimates *PLUS*  """

    First, change directories to the OBSID/pca directory, and then
    obtain a list-file with the housekeeping files with this command,

      ls FH5* > hkfiles.lis

    This should list all 5 PCU housekeeping files.


    Next, run pcadeadcalc2 on the Standard2 file,

      pcadeadcalc2 infile=FS4a outfile=FS4a_DT hkfiles=@hkfiles.lis

    This should create a new file, FS4a_DT, with deadtime correction
    quantities.


    Finally, run pcadeadcalc2 on the background file, using the results
    of the previous run via the 'std2file' parameter,

      pcadeadcalc2 infile=FS4a_bkg outfile=FS4a_bkgDT std2file=FS4a_DT

    Note that the file name used with 'std2file' is the file *with 
    dead-time quantities*, not the original Standard2 file.
    

HOW TO USE OUTPUTS

    This section briefly describes how these outputs can be used.

    The user can simply plot the various quantities to get
    a sense of the deadtime variations during an observation.  The
    most relevant quantities are TIME vs. LiveFracPcuN.

    For spectral analysis, the outputs of pcadeadcalc2 can be run as
    input to 'saextrct'.  Most importantly, the same time filtering
    (i.e. GTI files) can be applied to the accumulation of counts
    spectrum data and the live-time time quantities.

    For example, if the spectrum is accumulated like this,

       saextrct infile=FS4a gtiorfile=APPLY gtiandfile=myfile.gti 
         outroot=spect accumulate=ONE ... 
         columns=X1LSpecPcu2,X1RSpecPcu2 
         printmode=SPECTRUM lcmode=SUM spmode=SUM ...

    i.e. accumulate one summed spectrum for PCU2, then the user can
    make a similar live-time spectrum like this,

       saextrct infile=FS4a gtiorfile=APPLY gtiandfile=myfile.gti 
         outroot=live accumulate=ONE ... 
         columns=LiveTimePcu2 
         printmode=SPECTRUM lcmode=SUM spmode=SUM ...

    In other words, *ONLY CHANGING* the columns parameter to refer to
    the live-time column.  The result will be a spectrum with a single
    energy bin which is described as "COUNTS" but is really the number
    of live-time seconds.  You can print it with this command,

      ftlist live.pha T

      ==> 3915.53 sec  (EXAMPLE RESULT)

    which should print a single number.  This number is the *effective*
    exposure for the spectrum and can be placed in the EXPOSURE keyword of
    the original spectrum, for example like this,

      fthedit spect.pha EXPOSURE add 3915.53  ## EXAMPLE RESULT!!!


    A similar process should be used with the background file
    (FS4a_bkgDT in this example) to extract a spectrum with
    'saextrct', and the EXPOSURE of the resulting spectrum should be
    modified in a similar fashion.

    For light curve analysis, the user may extract a "light curve" of
    live-time values and correct the light curve values in a similar
    way.


PARAMETERS

    infile [filename]
        Name of the Standard2 or background file.

    outfile [filename]
        Name of the output file which will have dead-time quantities appended.

    (hkfiles) [string]
        When the input is Standard2 file, specify a list of PCA
        housekeeping files.  This can either be a comma-separated
        list, or a @filename.txt where filename.txt contains a list of
        files.  There must be exactly five files specified because there
        are five PCUs.

    (std2file) [string]
        When the input is a background estimate file, specify the
        output of a previous run of pcadeadcalc2 which has been applied
        to the corresponding Standard2 file.

    (breakfile = 'CALDB') [string]
        Set to a file name which contains PCU breakdown GTI
        information.  If set to 'CALDB', then the task will query
        CALDB for the appropriate file.  If set to 'NONE', then no PCU
        breakdown processing will be done.

    (zero_bad = YES) [boolean]
        If set, then the task will set the Xenon counts to zero any
        PCU which is considered to be in a "bad" science state at the
        given time, as described above.  If not set, then Xenon counts
        are not changed.

    (transition_bad = YES) [boolean]
        If set, then PCU high voltage transitions are considered "bad"
        science times (+/- 16 sec).  If not set, then only PCU high
        voltage "off" is considered bad.

    (propane_bad = YES) [boolean]
        If set, then PCUs are considered "bad" if their propane layers
        are gone.  If not set, then the propane layer status is not
        considered.

    (cleanup = yes) [boolean]
        Clean up scratch files?

    (chatter = 2) [int] range 0-5
        Verbosity level of output

    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        Overwrite output file?

    (history = yes) [boolean]
        Write standard HEADAS parameter history into output file?
