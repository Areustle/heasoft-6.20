NAME
     hxtback - a script that reads a HEXTE science or  housekeep-
     ing  FITS  file  and creates new FITS files based on cluster
     position.

USAGE
     hxtback [-i "infile"] [-bh]
 
DESCRIPTION
     If the infile parameter is not present, the  hxtback  script
     queries  the  user for a HEXTE science event or housekeeping
     input file.  FSELECT is then run to generate an output  file
     for  each cluster position which had data in the input file.
     The output files are created in the  default  directory  and
     have  names which are derived by appending to the input file
     name a suffix indicating the cluster position.  The possible
     suffixes are:
         _src     all on-source ( 0(1.5), 0(3.0) )
         _p       +1.5 deg or +3.0 deg (background)
         _m       -1.5 deg or -3.0 deg  (background)
         _bkg     all background (+-1.5, +-3.0 )
 
     Each output file will also have a goodtime extension listing
     the  goodtime  ranges  covered  by the file.
 
PARAMETERS (SWITCHES/FLAGS)
     -i infile
        The name of the input HEXTE science or housekeeping  FITS
        file that is to  be operated upon.
 
     -b Group all background data (+-1.5, +-3.0)  in  one  output
        file.
 
EXAMPLES
     1. hxtback -h
         Help text will be displayed.

     2. hxtback
         User will be prompted for filename.  A seperate  ouptput
         file will be created for each cluster position.

     3. hxtback -i FS50_3f3ad0b-3f3b040 -b
         Script will run without prompting,  using  FS50_3f3ad0b-
         3f3b040 as input file.  All background data will go in a
         single output file named FS50_3f3ad0b-3f3b040_bkg.
