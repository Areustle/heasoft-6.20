This script runs the ASMAPPEND tool on a collection of XTE ASM 
master files and their respective incoming files.  The user inputs
the names of the directories containing the master files and the incoming
files.  The user may also specify the types of files to append (e.g.
.lc or .col).  The master files are updated in place in the master 
subdirectory.

  Note that the script outputs a number of informational 
messages used in the process of development.

KNOWN BUGS:  
  A) The name of the subdirectories must not contain an 
underscore ("_"), as this will confuse the source name search 
routine.
  B) The script does not correctly update the master list if the 
last entry in the incoming list is not in the master.  We recommend
that the user put such entries into the master subdirectory by hand.
