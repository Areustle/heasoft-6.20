ASMCHANNEL v1.0

   This script separates an input XTE ASM color file into 
   separate light curve files for each of the different ASM 
   energy channels.  Currently, the ASM data is analyzed in
   3 channels: 1.3-3.0 kev; 3.0-5.0 kev; 5.0-12.2 kev.

   An input file of the form <infile>.col results in output
   files with names of the form <infile>_ch1.lc, <infile>_ch2.lc,
   and <infile>_ch3.lc.

USAGE
   asmchannel -h (print help) [prints this help page]
              -c (clobber)    [overwrite existing output file with same name?
                              [  (default: NO)]
