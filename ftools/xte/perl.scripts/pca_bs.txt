Starting up PCA_BS v.0.30


NAME 
    pca_bs v.0.30

USAGE
    pca_bs -[bcdhilptx]

DESCRIPTION 

    The user provides 
          a list of input files in the fits_files.txt format
          a root for the output filenames
          the binsize in seconds for the light curves
          an (optional) filename for an ASCII file containing
               time information (e.g. a TIMETRANS output file)

    and the PCA_BS will construct light curves in each of 6 energy
    bands for Layer 1 and for Layer 2+3. It will then subtract
    the Layer 2+3 'background' from the Layer 1 'source' with the
    appropriate scalings, as defined by the Arnold Rots/Keith Jahoda
    recipe for PCA lightcurve background subtraction for faint sources.
    (This memo is required reading before running this task.) 

    The channels are hardwired in, but can be changed by editing the 
    perl script itself.

    The p(i) and q(i) constants from the memo are set up on the first 
    page of the code, just under the startup banner, and can be changed   
    there if updated numbers are given. The script currently chooses
    the proper p and q coefficients based on the observation date.
    
    The X(i) constants from the memo can be subtracted out too.
    The script will, by default, choose the cosmic x-ray background
    rates based on observation date, but the user can specify either
    "NONE" to do no CXB subtraction or else the name of a file containing
    an alternate set of CXB rates.

PARAMETERS  (actually SWITCHES/FLAGS) (grouped by function):

     -i {file} - provide name of ASCII file containing list of XTE/SA
            files (assumed default: 'fits_files.txt').

     -p {file} - provide root for product files - i.e., 'pca_bs -p one' 
            will create files oneA_B.lc, where A = channel band, and 
            B = 1 or 23, depending on level, and background-subtracted 
            files oneA.lc   (assumed default: 'band').

     -t {file} - provide ASCII filename containing time filter info
            in the usual format, or INDEF or '-' for none.

     -x {file} - provide ASCII filename containing cosmic x-ray background info
            in the usual format; INDEF or '-' for default values; NONE for no
            cosmic x-ray background correction.

     -b {number} - provide requested binning for light curve file - i.e.
            'pca_bs -b 1.0' will create 1-second bins.
            (assumed default: 32 seconds).

     -c   - prompt for names of layer1 and layer2+3 column files

     -d   - Take default values for all parameters not set on the command
            line.

     -l   - Logfile switch. Currently, logging is the default (in a
            file pca_bs.log), and  -l will disable this logging.

     -h   - Print this help information.

EXAMPLES

     pca_bs 
     pca_bs -i infiles -p out -t times.tfl -b 256.0
     pca_bs -b 32.0 -p torres -d

NOTES

    PCA_BS is intended as a 'fast' tool to minimize the amount of
    FTOOLing around for the user with straightforward data analysis
    requirements. It is not intended to replace or reproduce the full
    functionality available from the individual FTOOLS.
