DESCRIPTION

    pcaextspect2 extracts a spectrum from PCA data stored in the
    Standard2 format.  This task performs spectrum extraction for both
    source and background, dead-time correction, and optionally
    calculates a PCA response matrix which corresponds to the
    observation.

    pcaextspect2 is a "convenience" script which makes it easier and
    less error-prone to extract a spectrum for most users.

    A key benefit is that users do not need special knowledge of when
    detectors become "dead" for various reasons.  Instead, the user
    can request *all* of the detectors they are interested in, and
    'pcaextspect2' will produce a spectrum which contains the subset
    of those detectors which have good live time.  For example, users
    can request all of the detectors all of the time
    (pculist="0,1,2,3,4"), and pcaextspect2 will automatically
    de-select the detectors which are disabled, or having a breakdown,
    etc.  This functionality relies on the "zero_bad" capabilities of
    the "pcadeadcalc2" task.

    Advanced users can still use the more basic tools for fine-grained
    control instead of this task.  Because extraction and dead-time
    correction require the user to perform several careful operations,
    the use of this tool is recommended to make sure that the
    operations are done consistently.  Generally, the PCA team and the
    RXTE GOF recomend to not change the default for the advance
    parameters of this tool without specific need.

    The input to this tool is a set of PCA Standard2 files.  To gain
    full benefit of this tool, the user *MUST* provide dead-time
    calculated version of the Standard2 file.  For beginning users,
    the output files of the 'pcaprepfile2' or 'pcaprepobsid' tasks are
    sufficient.  For advanced users, the equivalent output of
    'pcadeadcalc2' is acceptable.

    The user must provide *both* the source *and* background Standard2
    files.  Beginning users can use the output of 'pcaprepfile2' /
    'pcaprepobsid'; advanced users may use the output of 'pcabackest'
    if desired.

    The output of the task is a source spectrum file (.pha file) and a
    background spectrum file for the same time interval.  These files
    are dead-time corrected, and contain only counts and exposure from
    live detectors, as described in the help file for the task
    'pcadeadcalc2'.

    The output will be the total counts spectrum of all live
    detectors, with an exposure that is the sum of the exposures for
    the individual PCU detectors.  Thus, the rate spectrum appearing
    in software like XSPEC will have units of "counts per detector"
    ("counts per PCU").

    The task can also optionally calculate a response matrix.  This
    matrix is tailored for the specific observation and weighted
    appropriately.  In this case, users must specify the filter file
    using the 'filtfile' parameter.


CALCULATING A RESPONSE MATRIX

    If users wish to calculate their own response matrix at a later
    time, they can use 'pcarsp' task.  Because of the complexity of
    selecting the proper detectors and layers, the RXTE GOF and PCA
    teams recommend to allow this task to compute the response matrix,
    but it can be done "by hand."

    The important parameters for calling pcarsp are,
        -l (choose same layer list as used to extract spectrum)
        -p (choose same detector list as used to extract spectrum)
        -w INFILE (applies appropriate PCU weights for observation)

    The output spectrum produced by this task contains PCU weighting
    keywords than can be used automatically by selecting the "-w"
    parameter.

COMBINING SPECTRA

    If the user wishes to combine spectra produced by pcaextspect2 in
    some form of downstream processing, then these instructions may be
    of help.

    Users should combine the spectra with the following general settings:
       * sum the counts
       * sum the exposure
       * sum the responses weighted by relative exposure

    For the task 'mathpha' the settings should be
       * expr="spectrum1.pha + spectrum2.pha + spectrum3.pha + ..."
       * units='C' (output in counts)
       * exposure='CALC'

    Of course, this operation needs to be performed separately for
    both the source and background files.

    To combine the responses, the user should use the 'addrmf' task
    and an input file with weights.  The weights should be calculated
    according to the relative exposure.  For example, if spectrum1.pha
    has 1000 seconds of exposure and spectrum2.pha has 500 seconds of
    exposure then the weighting file should look like this:

       spectrum1.rsp   0.6667
       spectrum2.rsp   0.3333

    Note how 0.6667 equals (1000/1500) and 0.3333 equals (500/1500),
    where 1500 seconds is the total exposure of both.  By definition,
    the weights in the file must sum to 1.0.

PARAMETERS

    src_infile [string - file name or @filename]
        Name of an input "source" PCA Standard2 file or @filename.txt
        file name list.  These files should have been processed by
        'pcadeadcalc2', 'pcaprepfile2' or 'pcaprepobs2'.

    bkg_infile [string - file name or @filename]
        Name of an input "background" PCA Standard2 file or
        @filename.txt file name list.  Note that this file list
        should match one-for-one with the input files specified by the
        'src_infile' parameter.  These files should have been
        processed by 'pcadeadcalc2', 'pcaprepfile2' or 'pcaprepobs2'.

    src_phafile [string - file name]
        Name of output "source" spectrum, which will be corrected for
        dead-time.  The BACKFILE and RESPFILE keywords will be updated
        to point to the correct background and response files, if
        appropriate.

    bkg_phafile [string - file name]
        Name of output "background" spectrum, which will be corrected
        for dead-time.

    gtiandfile = "-" [string]
        Name of GTI "AND" time filtering, which is identical to the
        gtiandfile passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.
        See 'saextrct' for more information.

    pculist = "ALL" [string]
        A comma-separated list of PCU detector numbers, or "ALL".  The
        list of detectors should be in the range 0-4.  The value of
        "ALL" means use all detectors, i.e. ("0,1,2,3,4").

    layerlist = "ALL" [string]
        A comma-separated list of PCU anode layer numbers, or "ALL".
        The list of layers should be in the range 1-3.  The value of
        "ALL" means use all layers, i.e. ("1,2,3").  It is also
        possible to specify an explicit list of anode symbols, for
        example "X1L,X2L,X3L" for all left anodes or "X1R,X2R,X3R" for
        all right anodes.

    respfile = "NONE" [string]
        Name of output response matrix file, or "NONE".  The response
        matrix will be tailored for the specific observation.  The
        'filtfile' parameter must also be supplied when a response
        matrix is desired.  A value of "NONE" means to not calculate a
        response matrix.

    filtfile = "NONE" [string - file name]
        Name of RXTE filter file which covers the complete requested
        observation duration, and is used for calcalating a response
        matrix.  This parameter is not required if respfile=NONE.  You
        may give an .lis type file, but the filtfile.lis file
        must list only a single filter file (not multiple files).

    (deadcorrtype = "LIVE") [string]
        Name of live-time correction type to use.  Use "LIVE" for the true
        live-time correction, which results in a true dead-time corrected
        spectrum.  Use "ON" for the on-time column, which results in a
        standard non-dead-time corrected spectrum (the basic detector
        on-time exposure is calculated).

    (ra = "INDEF") [string]
        Right ascension of target in J2000 degrees.  The value
        overrides the RA_OBJ keyword value set in the PHA header.  If
        a value of "INDEF" is provided, then the source position in
        the PHA file is left unmodified.

    (dec = "INDEF") [string]
        Declination of target in J2000 degrees.  The value
        overrides the DEC_OBJ keyword value set in the PHA header.  If
        a value of "INDEF" is provided, then the source position in
        the PHA file is left unmodified.

    (gtiorfile = "APPLY") [string]
        Name of GTI "OR" time filtering, which is identical to the
        gtiorfile passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.

    (gticols = "START STOP") [string]
        Name of GTI start/stop column names, which is identical to the
        gticols passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.

    (timecol = "TIME") [string]
        Name of TIME column used for extraction, which is identical to
        the timecol passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.

    (timemin = INDEF) [double precision real]
        Minimum start time (MET) used for accumulation, which is
        identical to the timemin passed to 'saextrct' to produce the
        input spectrum.

    (timemax = INDEF) [double precision real]
        Maximum start time (MET) used for accumulation, which is
        identical to the timemax passed to 'saextrct' to produce the
        input spectrum.

    (timeint = INDEF) [double precision real]
        Comma-separated list of time intervals (MET), which is
        identical to the timeint passed to 'saextrct' to produce the
        input spectrum.

    (accumulate = "ONE") [string]
        Setting passed to 'saextrct'.  Use "ONE" to extract one summed
        spectrum (RECOMMENDED), or "MANY" to extract a "Type II"
        spectrum for each Standard2 column (NOT RECOMMENDED).
        WARNING: setting accumulate=MANY is not compatible with
        requesting a response matrix.

    (phazeroexp = YES) [boolean]
        If set to YES, then a spectrum is produced even if zero
        exposure is detected.  This occurs if the combination of GTIs
        and PCU on-time produces a valid spectrum but it has no live
        time.  If phazeroexp=NO, then no spectrum is produced if zero
        exposure is detected.

    (respzeroexp = NO) [boolean]
        If set to YES, then a dummy response matrix is calculated even
        if zero exposure is detected (all PCUs assigned equal weight).
        If respzeroexp=NO, then no response is calculated if zero
        exposure is detected.  You must use special care when setting
        respzeroexp=YES.  In particular, when combining spectra, the
        responses must be weighted according to exposure, otherwise
        the PCUs will be weighted incorrectly.

    (lcbinarray = INDEF) [string]
        Setting passed to 'saextrct'.  The default value is 400000.  Set
        to a larger value for better performance on larger data sets.

    (gtiarray = INDEF) [string]
        Setting passed to 'saextrct'.  The default value is 30000.  Set to
        a larger value if you exceed the limit.

CAVEATS

    Although it is possible to run this task against the "original"
    raw Standard2 files, the PCA team cannot attest to its
    correctness.  Also, the running of this task assumes that
    "zero_bad=YES" has been used when running
    pcaprepfile2/pcaprepobs2/pcadeadcalc2.  If zerobad=NO, then it is
    possible for the calculated exposures to be incorrect.
