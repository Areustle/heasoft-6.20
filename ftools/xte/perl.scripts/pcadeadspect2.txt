NAME
    pcadeadspect2 - Apply PCA dead-time correction to Standard2 spectra

USAGE
    pcadeadspect infile phafile outfile gtiorfile gtiandfile 
      timecol timemin timemax timeint

DESCRIPTION

    pcadeadspect2 applies a dead-time correction to a PCA Standard2
    spectrum file.

    It is assumed that the user has already run pcadeadcalc2 in order
    to compute the dead-time related quantities for the observation,
    and it is also assumed that the user has already extracted a spectrum
    for the times and detectors they are interested in.

    pcadeadspect2 is used to adjust the exposure time of the extracted
    spectrum so that it reflects the true live time of the instrument.
    pcadeadspect2 operates on both the "ONE" and "MANY" products
    of saextrct (i.e. Type I and Type II PHA files).

    IMPORTANT NOTE: The user must supply to pcadeadspect2 the
    *identical* time filtering GTI files which were used to make the
    spectrum.  If this is not done, then the calculated exposures will
    be less accurate than the original values!

    Other selections like which PCUs were extracted, and
    the type of spectrum file, are determined automatically.
    It is not necessary to supply energy selection settings because
    dead-time does not depend on pulse-height.


PARAMETERS

    infile [string - file name or @filename]
        Name of a FITS file or @filename.txt file name list, which
        is identical to the infile passed to 'saextrct' to produce
        the input spectrum

    phafile [string - file name]
        Name of Standard2 spectrum produced by 'saextrct' using the
        above 'infile' setting.

    outfile [string - output file name]
        Name of revised Standard2 spectrum file, whose exposure has
        been corrected for dead time.

    gtiorfile = "APPLY" [string]
        Name of GTI "OR" time filtering, which is identical to the
        gtiorfile passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.

    gtiandfile = "-" [string]
        Name of GTI "AND" time filtering, which is identical to the
        gtiandfile passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.

    (gticols = "START STOP") [string]
        Name of GTI start/stop column names, which is identical to the
        gticols passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.

    timecol = "TIME" [string]
        Name of TIME column used for extraction, which is identical to
        the timecol passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.

    timemin = INDEF [double precision real]
        Minimum start time (MET) used for accumulation, which is
        identical to the timemin passed to 'saextrct' to produce the
        input spectrum.

    timemax = INDEF [double precision real]
        Maximum start time (MET) used for accumulation, which is
        identical to the timemax passed to 'saextrct' to produce the
        input spectrum.

    timeint = INDEF [double precision real]
        Comma-separated list of time intervals (MET), which is
        identical to the timeint passed to 'saextrct' to produce the
        input spectrum.

    (deadcorrtype = "LIVE") [string]
        Name of live-time correction type to use.  Use "LIVE" for the true
        live-time correction, which results in a true dead-time corrected
        spectrum.  Use "ON" for the on-time column, which results in a
        standard non-dead-time corrected spectrum (the basic detector
        on-time exposure is calculated).

    (lcbinarray = INDEF) [string]
        Setting passed to 'saextrct'.  The default value is 400000.  Set
        to a larger value for better performance on larger data sets.

    (gtiarray = INDEF) [string]
        Setting passed to 'saextrct'.  The default value is 30000.  Set to
        a larger value if you exceed the limit.

    (maxmiss = INDEF) [string]
        Setting passed to 'saextrct'.  Not recommended to change unless needed.

    (mfracexp = INDEF) [string]
        Setting passed to 'saextrct'.  Not recommended to change unless needed.

    (cleanup = yes) [boolean]
        Clean up scratch files?

    (chatter = 2) [int] range 0-5
        Verbosity level of output

    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        Overwrite output file?

    (history = yes) [boolean]
        Write standard HEADAS parameter history into output file?

EXAMPLES

    1. saextrct infile=FS4a_DT outroot=spect gtiandfile=myfile.gti

        Sample 'saextrct' call which creates spect.pha spectrum with
        a user-generated GTI file (myfile.gti).  Note: not all parameters
        are shown!

    2. pcadeadspect2 infile=FS4a_DT phafile=spect.pha outfile=spect_DT.pha 
          gtiandfile=myfile.gti

        Result of step 1 is dead-time corrected using the identical
        time filtering criteria as used in step 1.  Note: not all parameters
        are shown!
    
CAVEATS

    You must use identical time filtering selections for both
    your run to saextrct and pcadeadspect2.
