NAME
    seselect -- a script that queries the user for  all  required  input
    and runs in sucession SEBITMASK and FSELECT to generate a FITS file.
    
    
USAGE
    seselct infile.fits expression column_name out_bitfile outfile.fits
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  FTOOL  script queries the user for an input science event fits
    file, and the appropriate filtering expression that is to be applied
    to  the  data.  SEBITMASK  and  FSELECT  are then run to generate an
    output file which contains that information.
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    infile [filename (only one can be operated on)]
        The name of the input XTE science event FITS file that is to  be
        operated upon.
    
    filter [expression or @filename containing the expression]
        This  filter expression must be expressed in standard C notation
        and contain the instruments that are being filtered upon,  e.g.,
        (E[CAL]  ==  1  &  (D[0:4]==0  |  D[0:4]==1) & E[VXH,VXL] == 3 &
        C[0:255] <= 100). DO NOT USE FORTRAN comparisons!
    
    column_name [column_name - Event in all standard SE files)
        This is the column name EXACTLY as given in the file that is  to
        have  the  above  FILTER  expression applied to it. Under normal
        circumstances this should be given as "Event".
    
    bitfile [filename]
        The name of the  output  file  that  will  contain  the  bitmask
        expression   that   was   generated  from  your  input  "filter" 
        expression. This will change from SE file to SE file  since  the
        data is stored as and nX bit pattern that varies.
    
    outfile [filename]
        The  name  of  the  SE  FITS  file  that  is  to be created that
        contains all of  the  information  that  matched  you  filtering
        criteria.

    1. seselect infile.fits @expfile Event bitfile outfile.fits
