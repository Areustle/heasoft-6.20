NAME
    proc2pcu - Pre-process RXTE/PCA binned-mode data files containing
               two separate channels of PCU data to produce files that
               are compatible with saextrct.

USAGE
    proc2pcu infile outfile pcugroup (clobber) (chatter) (history)

DESCRIPTION
    Several new RXTE PCA data modes were introduced in mid-2007. The new binned
    mode "B_250us_2PCU_0_249_H" divides the PCUs into two groups (1,3,5 and 2,4)
    and files containing data in this mode cannot be processed by saextrct. This
    script preprocesses these files and generates output that can be successfully
    handled by saextrct. One can output either the PCU 1,3,5 group, the PCU 2,4
    group, or the sum of both groups. The original XeCnt data column is preserved
    in the output file as OrigCntXe.

PARAMETERS

    infile [filename]
        Name of the PCA data file (must be 2PCU mode) to be processed

    outfile [filename]
        Name of the output file (suitable for processing by saextrct)

    pcugroup [string]
        Specifies which data should be written to the output file.
        Allowed values are:
           "1" or "024" or "135" (group 1; data from PCUs 0, 2, and 4)
           "2" or "13" or "24" (group 2; data from PCUs 1 and 3)
           "3" or "all" or "sum" (group 3; data from all PCUs)

    (chatter = 1) [int] range 0-5
        Verbosity level of output

    (clobber = no) [boolean]
        Overwrite output file?

    (history = yes) [boolean]
        Write standard HEADAS parameter history into output file?

EXAMPLES
    1. proc2pcu
    2. proc2pcu infile=FS37_1c330360-1c33099c.gz outfile=pcu024 pcugroup=1 clobber=yes

NOTES
    To date the relevant PCA data mode has been only used rarely, primarily for
    observations of Sco X-1 in proposal P93067.
