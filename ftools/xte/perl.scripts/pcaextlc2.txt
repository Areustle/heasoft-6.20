NAME
    pcaextlc2 - Extract PCA Standard2 light curve and background, and 
          optional deadtime correction

USAGE
    pcaextlc2 src_infile bkg_infile outfile gtiandfile pculist 
       layerlist binsz

DESCRIPTION

    pcaextlc2 extracts a light curve from PCA data stored in the
    Standard2 format.  This task performs light curve extraction for
    both source and background, and optionally performs both
    background subtraction and/or dead-time correction.

    pcaextlc2 is a "convenience" script which makes it easier and
    less error-prone to extract a light curve for most users.

    A key benefit is that users do not need special knowledge of when
    detectors become "dead" for various reasons.  Instead, the user
    can request *all* of the detectors they are interested in, and
    'pcaextlc2' will produce a light curve which contains the subset
    of those detectors which have good live time, and is represents
    the average rate per detector.  

    For example, users can request all of the detectors all of the
    time (pculist="0,1,2,3,4"), and pcaextlc2 will automatically
    de-select the detectors which are disabled, or having a breakdown,
    etc.  This functionality relies on the "zero_bad" capabilities of
    the "pcadeadcalc2" task.

    Advanced users can still use the more basic tools for fine-grained
    control instead of this task.  Because extraction and dead-time
    correction require the user to perform several careful operations,
    the use of this tool is recommended to make sure that the
    operations are done consistently.  Generally, the PCA team and the
    RXTE GOF recomend to not change the default for the advance
    parameters of this tool without specific need.

    The input to this tool is a set of PCA Standard2 files.  To gain
    full benefit of this tool, the user *MUST* provide dead-time
    calculated version of the Standard2 file.  For beginning users,
    the output files of the 'pcaprepfile2' task are sufficient.  For
    advanced users, the equivalent output of 'pcadeadcalc2' is
    acceptable.

    If background estimates are required, the user must background
    Standard2 files, also with dead-time quantities calculated.

    The output of the task is a light curve file (.lc) file which
    contains the source count rate.  Using the default settings to
    this task, the output light curve file has rates that are
    dead-time corrected, and contain only counts and exposure from
    live detectors, as described in the help file for the task
    'pcadeadcalc2'.

    If lcmode=RATE, the output is a RATE column (counts per live
    detector per unit live time), and the ERROR column represents the
    Poisson rate error.  If lcmode=COUNTS, the output is a COUNTS
    column (total counts during each time bin), ERROR is the Poisson
    counting error.  For lcmode=COUNTS, the FRACEXP value can be
    greater than 1.0, indicating more than one PCU is enabled.  In
    this case, the rate per live PCU can be computed as
    COUNTS/TIMEDEL/FRACEXP.

    For dead-time purposes, if deadcorrtype=LIVE then the
    live-time-corrected values of the light curve samples is computed,
    and the live time is reported in the column LiveTime.  Dead-time
    corrected samples are indicated by the presence of the DEADAPP='T'
    keyword.  If deadcorrtype=ON, then the light curve samples are
    corrected for number of PCUs enabled (i.e. "on-time"), but not for
    dead-time.  The on-time is then reported in the OnTime column.  If
    only correcting for on-time, then DEADAPP='F'alse.

    For background subtraction purposes, a set of background estimates
    must be supplied in the bkg_infile parameter.  If bkgsub=NO, then
    background values are produced and reported in the BACKV and BACKE
    columns, but they are not subtracted.  If bkgsub=YES, then the
    background is subtracted, i.e. RATE is recomputed as (RATE-BACKV),
    and ERROR is recomputed as SQRT(ERROR*ERROR+BACKE*BACKE).  The
    presence of background subtraction is indicated by the BACKAPP='T'
    keyword.  


PARAMETERS

    src_infile [string - file name or @filename]
        Name of an input "source" PCA Standard2 file or @filename.txt
        file name list.  These files should have been processed by
        'pcadeadcalc2', 'pcaprepfile2' or 'pcaprepobs2'.

    bkg_infile [string - file name or @filename]
        Name of an input "background" PCA Standard2 file or
        @filename.txt file name list.  Note that this file list
        should match one-for-one with the input files specified by the
        'src_infile' parameter.  These files should have been
        processed by 'pcadeadcalc2', 'pcaprepfile2' or 'pcaprepobs2'.
        A value of "NONE" indicates no background estimates are desired.

    outfile [string - file name]
        Name of output light curve file.

    gtiandfile = "-" [string]
        Name of GTI "AND" time filtering, which is identical to the
        gtiandfile passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.
        See 'saextrct' for more information.

    pculist = "ALL" [string]
        A comma-separated list of PCU detector numbers, or "ALL".  The
        list of detectors should be in the range 0-4.  The value of
        "ALL" means use all detectors, i.e. ("0,1,2,3,4").

    layerlist = "ALL" [string]
        A comma-separated list of PCU anode layer numbers, or "ALL".
        The list of layers should be in the range 1-3.  The value of
        "ALL" means use all layers, i.e. ("1,2,3").  It is also
        possible to specify an explicit list of anode symbols, for
        example "X1L,X2L,X3L" for all left anodes or "X1R,X2R,X3R" for
        all right anodes.

    binsz = 16.0 [real]
        Time bin size for light curve samples, in seconds.  This value
        must be an integer multiple of 16 because that is the time
        sample size of Standard2 data.

    (lcmode = "RATE") [string]
        String giving the binning mode for accumulating counts, either
        "RATE" or "SUM".  A setting of lcmode="RATE" produces a rate
        light curve (counts per on-time or per live-time).  A setting
        of lcmode="SUM" produces a counts light curve (total counts
        per bin).

    (deadcorrtype = "LIVE") [string]
        Name of live-time correction type to use.  Use "LIVE" for the true
        live-time correction, which results in a true dead-time corrected
        spectrum.  Use "ON" for the on-time column, which results in a
        standard non-dead-time corrected spectrum (the basic detector
        on-time exposure is calculated).

    (bkgsub = YES) [boolean] 
        Setting that determines whether background is subtracted or
        not.  If bkgsub=YES, then background is subtracted.  If
        bkgsub=NO, then background is listed in the output file
        (columns BACKV and BACKE) but not subtracted.  This setting is
        ignored if bkg_infile="NONE".

    (gtiorfile = "APPLY") [string]
        Name of GTI "OR" time filtering, which is identical to the
        gtiorfile passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.

    (gticols = "START STOP") [string]
        Name of GTI start/stop column names, which is identical to the
        gticols passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.

    (timecol = "TIME") [string]
        Name of TIME column used for extraction, which is identical to
        the timecol passed to 'saextrct' to produce the input spectrum.

    (timemin = INDEF) [double precision real]
        Minimum start time (MET) used for accumulation, which is
        identical to the timemin passed to 'saextrct' to produce the
        input spectrum.

    (timemax = INDEF) [double precision real]
        Maximum start time (MET) used for accumulation, which is
        identical to the timemax passed to 'saextrct' to produce the
        input spectrum.

    (timeint = INDEF) [double precision real]
        Comma-separated list of time intervals (MET), which is
        identical to the timeint passed to 'saextrct' to produce the
        input spectrum.

CAVEATS

    Although it is possible to run this task against the "original"
    raw Standard2 files, the PCA team cannot attest to its
    correctness.  Also, the running of this task assumes that
    "zero_bad=YES" has been used when running
    pcaprepfile2/pcaprepobs2/pcadeadcalc2.  If zerobad=NO, then it is
    possible for the calculated exposures to be incorrect.
