Notes on updating IGRF magnetic field model (version 12)
2015-04-28
Craig Markwardt

Here is what I did to update the IGRF magnetic field for version 12,
which was released in early 2015.

The coefficients can be found here:
  http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf.html  
Specifically for version 12, I used the following link:
  http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf12coeffs.txt
And these commands:
  curl http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/IAGA/vmod/igrf12coeffs.txt
  dos2unix -U igrf12coeffs.txt  
(the last command deals with DOS CR-LFs)

Next, check out getcoeff_v12 and modify to taste.  Basically you are
going to be modifying the column numbers and adding the right headers
to make XgrfNNNN.dat files.  The last file will be a "derivative" file
which just gives the expected change in the coefficients, extrapolated
forward in time to the next half-decade.  For this version, this
covers 2015-2020.

Use this script to generate the XgrfNNNN_v12.dat files for the year of
interest.  Of course there will be one igrfNNNNs_v12.dat at the last
epoch which is the derivative term.

Now go look at create_data_statements_v12.pro, and edit that to taste.
Read the appropriate data files for the years of interest.  In this
case, since 2010 and 2015 were modified, this means that years 2005,
2010, 2015 in the table need to be updated.  The index=NN keyword
should be updated to accomodate the new year or years.

When running this script, a set of FORTRAN DATA statements is
produced, which can be substituted into the geocal.f file.  This huge
data statement begins around line 780 in the file.  For years that
have been *updated* one needs to remove the old lines from the FORTRAN
file to make room for the revised numbers.  For the new years, simply
add them to the file.

Now go to geocal.f, around line 775, and edit the maximum dimensions
of the arrays.  Bump up the dimension of TZERO(), GG(*,13,13)
GGT(*,13,13) NMAX(*) and LABEL(*). The second and third dimensions of
GG() and GGT() can remain 13x13, which corresponds to the dimensions
of the coefficient block.  In 2015, the maximum dimension was bumped
up to 15, so the next time this is done in 2020, it should be bumped
up to 16.



Previous Notes for version 11

Here are some notes about updating the IGRF magnetic field model, which 
I know for a fact is included in the prefilter code, as well as xtefilt 
("starksubs.f" is an obvious giveaway of Mike Stark).

The default IGRF software is designed to access the magnetic field data 
via input files stored on disk (in ASCII format), but the FTOOLS codes 
have been modified to use an internal array defined by DATA statements. 
  In principle this could be changed to use a CALDB (FITS) structure, 
but that's for another time...

The official data files are available from the NSSDC web site here:
  http://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/models/geomagnetic/igrf/fortran_code/
Of course, this is not exactly the same format used in the FORTRAN files.

I've created a few IDL scripts which ingest the files and create an 
equivalent FORTRAN DATA statement.  Please see
   /home/lhea/craigm/lib/idl/util/{read_igrf.pro,print_igrf.pro}
The READ_IGRF script will ingest the disk files, and PRINT_IGRF will 
print them as a FORTRAN DATA statement.  There is an example included in 
the headers of the file.

I recently created a new file geocal.f, which extends the validity of
the data files through "provisional 2010", which is the best that is
available.  The original file that exists in CVS now is only valid
through "provisional 1995" which is very old indeed.  I used the IDL
script create_data_statements.pro to create the data statements which
were inserted into the fortran file.  Compare to geocal.f.orig from
before the change.

I believe that this should be a drop-in replacement file for geocal.f,
which exists in both prefilter and xtefilt.

Regarding moving this forward, I think it makes sense to make a test 
version with the new code, and then the instrument teams could test how 
much this changes things.

--- old info about 2009 file
In 2009 I was able to make a new file geocal_2009.f, which extended the 
validity through "provisional 2005" (old file was valid up through 
"provisional 1995").  Today, two years later, the both the "definitive 
2005" and "provisional 2010" files are now available.  The examples 
shown in the header of read_igrf.pro are the *exact* code I used to 
produce a revised geocal.f data file.

At the time in 2009, I created a sample geocal_2009.f file with new 1995, 
2000 and 2005 DATA statements.  Please see this directory:
   /home/lhea/craigm/igrf-update/{geocal.f.orig,geocal.f}
which has the "before" and "after" versions of geocal.f which make it 
work.  Aside from the actual DATA statement, a few fortran dimensions 
had to be changed.  I don't believe any other changes were required.

Obviously, to make this more up to date, we would need to update to 
available "provisional 2010" data.  I believe that both the RXTE/xtefilt 
and attitude/prefilter programs can be updated in the same way.
