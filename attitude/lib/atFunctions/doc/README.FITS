	ABOUT THIS DIRECTORY       		930205    M. Itoh


This directory contains revised programs from the atFunctions.
Revisions were made
	
	(1) to read orbital elements from FRF orbit files.

	(2) to add time derivatives of eccentricity and inclination in the 
	    orbital elements.

atSetElement and atFunctions.h are revised.  New version for atSetElement
is named atSetElement2.

One need to link with
 
	(1) fitsio.f  
		and 
	(2) fitssun.f for sparc station,  or  fitsdec.f for dec station 

when compile.  See the Makefile as an example.  This Makefile makes a simple 
sample program samplef. fitssun.for (or fitsdec.f ) is a source code related 
to fitsio that takes care of machine dependent part of the utility for sun 
(or dec). 

Predicted orbital elements for ASTRO-D are in  orbit.data.
orb_fitsfile is the FRF orbit file created from orbit.data.  Currently, they 
contain only one set of orbital elements.
