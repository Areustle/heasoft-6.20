COORDINATOR (Jun99)                                  COORDINATOR (Jun99)



NAME
    coordinator  --  Converts  raw  coordinates  to  detector  and   sky 
    coordinates
    
    
    
USAGE
      coordinator eventfile attfile teldef
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    This  is  a  mission-independant  tool  for  taking  raw  coordinate 
    columns in an event file and converting them  to  detector  and  sky
    coordinates.   In  other  words  it fills the appropriate coordinate
    columns.  Currently the ASCA and  Astro-E  missions  are  supported.
    Note  that  the  details  of  which  columns  to  read and write are
    specified in the "teldef" calibration file.
    
    
    
PARAMETERS
    
    
    eventfile [stirng]
        This is the name of the event file  containing  raw  coordinates
        and to which detector and sky coordinates will be written.
    
    
    (eventext = "EVENT") [string]
        This  is  the  name  of  the  FITS file extension containing the
        event list.
    
    
    (timecol = "TIMECOL") [string]
        This is the name of the FITS column containing time values.
    
    
    (skyxnull = 0 ) [integer]
        "Null" value to  be  written  to  the  sky  X  column  when  the
        coordinates  are  outside  the  field  of view or if the current
        attitude is unknown.
    
    
    (skyynull = 0 ) [integer]
        "Null" value to  be  written  to  the  sky  Y  column  when  the
        coordinates  are  outside  the  field  of view or if the current
        attitude is unknown.
    
    
    attfile
        Name of attitude file to be used  to  fill  the  sky  coordinate
        columns.   If set to "NONE", the sky coordinate columns will not
        be filled.
    
    
    teldef
        Name of the "Telescope Definition" calibration file.
    
    
    (aberration = yes) [boolean]
        Should the effects of abberation  be  taken  into  account  when
        calculating   the  sky  coordinate  values?  Abberation  is  the 
        apparent bending of light due to the Earth's  orbit  around  the
        Sun.  This is at most a ~20 arc sec effect.  For normal use this
        parameter should be set to "yes".
    
    
    (follow_sun = yes) [boolean]
        Should abberation be recalculated for each event  time?  If  set
        to  "no"  the  abberation  at  the  time  given  by the "MJDOBS"
        keyword will be used for all events. Setting  this  to  "no"  is
        acceptable  except  for very long observations and will make the
        program run slightly faster.  The "yes" setting should  be  used
        for highest accuracy.
    
    
    ra [real]
        This  is  the Right Ascension in decimal degrees of the point to
        appear in the center of sky coordinate images.
    
    
    dec [real]
        This is the Declination in  decimal  degrees  of  the  point  to
        appear in the center of sky coordinate images.
    
    
    (randomize = yes) [boolean]
        If  this  is set to "no" the program will assume that each event
        occured at the center of its raw coordinate pixel. If it is  set
        to  "yes",  the  detector and sky coordinates will be calculated
        assuming a random location within  the  raw  pixel.  In  general
        this  should  be  set  to  "yes",  however, randomization may be
        undesirable if the raw pixels are much larger than the  detector
        or sky pixels (e.g. the Astro-E XRS).
    
    
    ( seed = -1956) [integer]
        Random  number generator seed to be used if the "randomize" flag
        is set to "yes". For a given seed value, the same  results  will
        happen each time the program is run.
    
    
    (timemargin = 32.0) [real]
        Allowed  time  to extrapolate the spacecraft attitude before the
        first or after the last row in the attitude file. Events  beyond
        the   time  margin  will  have  their  coordinates  set  to  the 
        "skyxnull" and "skynull" values.
