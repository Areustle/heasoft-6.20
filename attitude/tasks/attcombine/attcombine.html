<h2>NAME</h2>

attcombine

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>attcombine first=&lt;filename&gt; second=&lt;filename&gt;
	combined=&lt;filename&gt;</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

    An attitude file represents a rotation as a function of time.
    Usually it is interpreted to mean a rotation with respect to a
    fixed coordinates system, such that it specifies a spacecraft
    attitude with respect to that coordinate system. However an attitude
    file can represent any arbitrary rotation. This tool takes
    two attitude files and merges them to produce a new attitude
    file which represents the result of applying first one rotation
    and then the other. It is primarily used with det2att to
    apply corrections to a spacecraft attitude.

<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>first [filename]
<dd>Name of first input attitude file.
<p>

<dt>second [filename]
<dd>Name of second input attitude file.
<p>

<dt>combined [filename]
<dd>Name of output (combined) attitude file.
<p>

<dt>(alignfile = NONE) [filename]
<dd>Name of satellite alignment file or NONE or CALDB.  If not NONE, a
column POINTING will be created in the combined attitude file holding the
RA, Dec, Roll corresponding to the combined output quaternion, and the
POINTING column from the first input attitude file will be copied to the
output attitude file as POINTING_ORIG.
<p>

<dt>(interpolation = LINEAR) [string]
<dd>Attitude interpolation method.  Records in the combined output file
have the same timestamps as those in the first input file.  When the
interpolation method is LINEAR, quaternions from the second input file
with surrounding timestamps are linearly interpolated to the input time
to arrive at the correction quaternion.  When the interpolation method
is CONSTANT, the quaternion from the second input file with the timestamp
closest to the input time is applied.  For times outside the bounds of
the second input file, the correction quaternion is CONSTANT extrapolated.
<p>

<dt>(history = yes) [boolean]
<dd>Write parameter history?
<p>

<dt>(chatter = 1) [enumerated integer]
<dd>Standard HEAdas chatter parameter.
