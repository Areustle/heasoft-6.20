    <BRIEFLY>Combines the rotations in two attitude files.</BRIEFLY>
    <DESCRIPTION>
    An attitude file represents a rotation as a function of time.
    Usually it is interpreted to mean a rotation with respect to a
    fixed coordinates system, such that it specifies a spacecraft
    attitude with respect to that coordinate system. However an attitude
    file can represent any arbitrary rotation. This tool takes
    two attitude files and merges them to produce a new attitude
    file which represents the result of applying first one rotation
    and then the other. It is primarily used with det2att to
    apply corrections to a spacecraft attitude.
