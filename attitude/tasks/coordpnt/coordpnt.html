<h2>NAME</h2>

coordpnt - Convert a single point or region file from one coordinate system to another. 

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt>coordpnt input outfile  telescop instrume ra dec roll teldeffile startsys stopsys</tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

'coordpnt' is a mission-independent tool for transforming either a single coordinate point or a region file from one
coordinate system to another.  
The input is either a pair of numbers separated by a comma (single point mode)
or a filename (region file mode).   
<p>
 It converts in both directions 
(RAW to SKY and SKY to RAW) and through multiple sets of 
coordinates. See also the help file for the 'coordevt' tool.
<p>
'Coordpnt' supports all region shapes  supported by the
 cfitsio 'regfilter' routine. Details about various region shapes can be found at 
<a href="http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html">http://ds9.si.edu/doc/ref/region.html</a>. 
<p>
The regions shapes supported by 'coordpnt' are listed below: 
<dl>
<dt>1.  Circle: circle x y radius 
<dt>2.  Annulus: annulus x y inner outer n=# / annulus x y r1 r2 r3... 
<dt>3.  Ellipse: ellipse x y radius radius angle
<dt>4.  Ellipse Annulus: ellipse x y r11 r12 r21 r22 n=# [angle] / ellipse x y r11 r12 r21 r22 r31 r32 ... [angle] 
<dt>5.  Box/Rectangle: box x y width height angle
<dt>6.  Diamond: diamond point x y  
<dt>7.  PIE/Sector: xcenter ycenter angle1 angle2
<dt>8.  Polygon: x1 y1 x2 y2 ... xn yn
<dt>9.  Point: point x y # point=[circle|box|diamond|cross|x|arrow|boxcircle] [size] / circle point x y 
<dt>10. Line: line x1 y1 x2 y2 # line=[0|1] [0|1]
<dt>11. Panda: panda x y startangle stopangle nangle inner outer nradius
<dt>12. Epanda: epanda x y startangle stopangle nangle inner outer nradius [angle]
<dt>13. Bpanda: bpanda x y startangle stopangle nangle inner outer nradius [angle]
<p>
When a region is transformed, all region descriptors (center, dimensions, rotations)
are transformed 
so that in both the destination and origin system, the region covers the same part 
of the coordinate space. 
If there are multiple 
regions within a single input region file, then all regions are transformed to the
final coordinate system.

<p>
<tt> Using the ra/dec/roll and ranom/decnom/rollnom parameters </tt>
<p>
'coordpnt' may be used to simulate deviations from the nominal pointing to 
mimic the effects in flight of any imperfections in the attitude control. 
This is done by 
adjusting the ranom/decnom/rollnom parameters separately from the ra/dec/roll 
of the actual pointing. 
By default, the 'ranom' and 'decnom' are set to the same value that of the pointing, 
and rollnom is set to 0. 
<p>
These groups
of parameters are used only in conversions that include the SKY coordinate system. 
'coordpnt' maintains and uses two 
attitude quaternions. One for the nominal pointing, and the other for the actual pointing. 
The actual pointing,
given by the parameters ra/dec/roll, represents the
center of the field of view of the instrument, or the center of the FOC coordinate system. 
It corresponds to the time-dependent attitude in 'coordevt'.
The nominal pointing, given by the parameters ranom/decnom/rollnom, represents the
center of the SKY coordinate system and the orientation of the SKY system with respect to
the Celestial coordinates. By default the positive SKY-Y axis 
points toward the North Celestial Pole ('rollnom=0.0').  <p>

The transformation between SKY and RADEC coordinates depends only on the nominal
pointing ranom/decnom/rollnom and not on ra/dec/roll. 
The transformation between the focal plane (FOC) coordinates and SKY coordinates depends 
on the difference between the actual and nominal pointing.  If the default parameter settings
are used for ranom/decnom/rollnom, then this transformation is only a roll, determined
by the 'roll' parameter.  If the user chooses to vary 'ranom' and 
'decnom' separately from 'ra' and 'dec', then the transformation includes 
a linear shift in X and Y in addition to a roll.
<p>
<tt> Hitomi specific configuration: Multiseg and winoffset parameters</tt>
<p>
<dt>
The following parameters multisegpar', 'winoffsetx' and 'winoffsety' are used 
in the transformation and currently set at default values appropriate for one 
of the Hitomi/SXI mode. 
 To modify them, users are advised to read the documentation on coordinate system
 relative to the mission. 
 Below is a short summary for Hitomi. 
 </dt>

<p>
The 'multisegpar' parameters are used when the input teldeffile 
contains a 'TRTYPEn = MULTISEG' transformation. This type of transformation involves 
an initial coordinate system that is multiplexed in some way (e.g. origin X0, Y0 
could transform to multiple different destination Xi, Yi). The 'multisegpar' 
parameters determine the specific transformation to be applied by indexing a 
MULTISEGn_COEFF table in the teldef file. 'Coordpnt' retrieves the proper coefficients 
from the table based on the values of the 'multisegpar' parameters and uses these 
coefficients to build the appropriate transformation based on a hard-coded algebraic 
formula.  This formula also uses the values of two other parameters 'winoffsetx' 
and 'winoffsety', which are supplied as separate parameters. 
Below is an example from the Hitomi/SXI. 
<p>

In the SXI, there are four 'multiseg' properties, which are used to decode the event data in
the transformation from the RAW to the ACT coordinates.  The properties are listed in the
order in which they appear in the SXI TelDef file, which is the order in which the 
 'multisegpar' parameters must be given.
<p>
1. SEGMENT.  Each SXI CCD chip has two independent segments, called AB and CD.  A photon
can land on either segment and the segment ID, 'SEGMENT=0' for segment AB or SEGMENT=1 
for segment CD is written to the data stream. 
<p>
2. READNODE.  Each segment has two read-out nodes, A and B for segment AB and C and D for
segment CD.  The choice of read-out node is commendable in the flight software.  The choice
of readout nodes is written to the data stream, where 'READNODE=0' denotes node A or C and 
'READNODE=1' denotes node B or D. 
<p>
3. WINOPT.  The SXI chips can be operated in commendable "window" modes, wherein a 
specified part of a chip is read out multiple times during a read out interval.  The
WINOPT property is set to 'WINOPT=0' if windowing is not used (full chip read out) or to 
'WINOPT=1' if windowing is used.
<p>
4. WIN_SIZE.  There are four possible sizes of the window that can be read out in 
windowing mode, including full chip readout.  The commendable size of the window is written 
to the data stream with one of four possible values:  'WIN_SIZE=640' for full chip read out,
'WIN_SIZE=160' for 1/4 chip read out, 'WIN_SIZE=80' for 1/8 chip read out and 'WIN_SIZE=40'
for 1/16 chip read out.  These are not independent of WINOPT; 'WIN_SIZE=640' only applies
for 'WINOPT=0', the other values of WIN_SIZE can apply when 'WINOPT=1'.
<p>
The SEGMENT, READNODE and WIN_SIZE properties are all set independently, yielding 
a total of 16 (2 x 2 x 4) possible combinations.
<p>
As an example, to simulate a situation where a photon is read out in segment AB, read node B,
with 1/8 windowing mode, one would provide multisegpar parameters "0,1,1,80",
for 'SEGMENT=0, READNODE=1, WINOPT=1, WIN_SIZE=80'.  Similarly setting multisegpar="1,0,0,640"
would mean segment CD, node C, full windowing mode.  Any out of range or incompatible
parameters leads to an error, like for example multisegpar="2,0,0,640" (out of range) 
or "1,0,1,640" ('WINOPT' and 'WIN_SIZE' options incompatible).
<p> The 'winoffsetx' and 'winoffsety' parameters are related to the windowing mode, 
but are set independently. For SXI, 'winoffsetx' should always be zero (it is
in fact ignored in the SXI TelDef), and 'winoffsety' can vary, but is nominally linked
to WIN_SIZE:
<ol>
<li> WIN_SIZE=640, winoffsety=1
<li> WIN_SIZE=160, winoffsety=415
<li> WIN_SIZE=80, winoffsety=455
<li> WIN_SIZE=40, winoffsety=475
</ol>
Currently The Hitomi/SXI is the only instrument to use the MULTISEG capabilities.

<dl>

<dt>input [string]

<dd>Input point or region to be transformed.  The input string can be 
one of the following.
<dd> 1) A pair of numbers separated by a comma, representing a single point in the
coordinate system specified by the startsys parameter.  The default is the
lowest-level coordinate system defined in the teldef file.
<dd> 2) A single pixel number in the case where the 
startsys coordinate system is represented by pixel numbers, as opposed to
positions in a coordinate grid.
<dd> 3) The name of an ASCII region file containing at least one standard format
region defined in the startsys coordinate system.    
<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]

<dd> This parameter should be set to "NONE" except when the input parameter is a name of a file. 
Then it is set to the name of the output file that contains the regions
transformed from the startsys to the stopsys coordinate system.     
<p>

<dt>telescop [string]

<dd> The name of the telescope for which the coordinate systems in the transformation
are defined.  The value of telescop must be the name of a valid mission 
(e.g. Swift, Suzaku, Hitomi) and must match the TELESCOP keyword in the teldef file.    
<p>

<dt>instrume [string]

<dd> The name of the instrument for which the coordinate systems in the transformation
are defined.  The value of instrume must be the name of a valid 
instrument on the mission given by telescop  
and must match the INSTRUME keyword in the teldef file.   
<p>

<dt>ra = -999.000 [real]

<dd>The Right Ascension in decimal degrees of the actual pointing, representing
the center of the field of view of the instrument.  This must be a value between 0 and 360.   
<p>

<dt>dec = -999.000 [real]

<dd>The declination in decimal degrees of the actual pointing, representing the
center of the field of view of the instrument.  This must be a value between -90 and +90.   
<p>

<dt>roll = 0.0 [real]

<dd>The roll angle in decimal degrees between the SKY coordinate system and the FOC
coordinate system.  The roll angle is about the center of the SKY system and is 
measured counterclockwise from the positive SKY Y axis to the positive FOC Y axis.   
<p>

<dt>(ranom = -999.000) [real]

<dd>The Right Ascension in decimal degrees of the nominal pointing, representing the 
center of the SKY coordinate system. When set to -999.000 (the default), 'ranom'
is identical to 'ra'. Otherwise, this must be a value between 0 and 360.    
<p>

<dt>(decnom = -999.000) [real]

<dd>The declination in decimal degrees of the nominal pointing, representing the center of
the SKY coordinate system. 
 When set to -999.000 (the default), 'ranom'
is identical to 'dec'. Otherwise, this must be a value between  -90 and +90.   
<p>
<dt>(rollnom = 0.0) [real]

<dd>The roll angle in decimal degrees between the SKY coordinate system and the Celestial
coordinates.  The roll angle is about the center of the SKY system and is 
measured counterclockwise from the North celestial axis to the positive SKY Y axis. 
By default, 'rollnom' is set to zero, which aligns the SKY system with the Celestial 
system. 
<p>

<dt>(teldeffile = CALDB) [filename]

<dd> Name of the Telescope Definition (TelDef) file, which specifies the 
coordinate systems and transformation properties. 
If the parameter is set to CALDB, the default, the file is read from the calibration database. 
If a file name is provided, then 
the TELESCOP and INSTRUME keywords in 
the file must match exactly the values of the telescop
and instrume parameters. 
The tool supports TelDef file format versions 0. through 0.2.
 

<p>

<dt>(startsys = LOWEST) [string]

<dd>
The name of the starting coordinate system of the requested conversion. 
When startsys is set to 'LOWEST', the default, the conversion 
begins with the lowest level system present in the teldef
file as identified by the parameter 'COORD0', usually 'RAW'. 
Setting startsys=HIGHEST
and stopsys to LOWEST, the task converts the top-level
coordinates into all the other coordinate systems.
In
addition to the coordinate systems defined in the teldef file, 'startsys'
can be set to 'RADEC', which indicates that the output coordinates are the pair 
(ra,dec) in decimal degrees.   
<p>



<dt>(stopsys = HIGHEST) [string]
<dd> The name of the ending coordinate system of the conversion.
If stopsys is set to HIGHEST, then the coordinate
transformation chain ends with the highest-level
system, usually 'SKY'.   
In
addition to the coordinate systems defined in the teldef file, 'stopsys'
can be set to 'RADEC', which indicates that the output coordinates are the pair 
(ra,dec) in decimal degrees.   
<p>

<dt>(multisegpar = NULL) [string]

<dd>The values of the multi-segment parameters, which are required when the 
teldef file contains a 'TRTYPEn = MULTISEG' transformation (e.g. Hitomi SXI).   
These parameters must be 
specified as a list of numbers separated by a comma in with the following way: 
a) There must be one number for each parameter. b) The numbers 
must be in the same order as in the teldef. c) The numbers must be within their allowed range 
(see the example given above). 
</dl>
If there is a MULTISEG transformation for the given instrument, 
but the multisegpar are left to their default 'NULL' value, the code assumes 
the property values listed in the first
row of the teldef MULTISEGn_COEFF table. If there is no
MULTISEG transformation for the given instrument, this parameter is ignored.     
<p>

<dt>(rawtodetseg = 0) [string]

<dd>The value of the segment, which is required when the teldef file contains a
RAWTODET type transformation governed by segments (e.g. Hitomi SXI),
as opposed to a PIXEL_MAP (e.g. Hitomi SXS). This transformation
is multiplexed, and the value of 'rawtodetseg' determines the transformation.
If the value of this parameter is out of range the code exits with an error.   
<p>

<dt>(pixeltest = CENTER) [string]

<dd>
This parameter determines how to handle the extent of overlap between a region file 
and pixels. 
When pixeltest is set to CENTER (DEFAULT), the center of the pixel 
must be within the region for inclusion in the output pixel list.  
When pixeltest is set to PARTIAL, at least one corner of the pixel 
must be within the region. When pixeltest is set to TOTAL, all corners of the 
pixel must be within the region. 
Note that a very small region that does not include any pixel corners may 
produce a zero-length pixel list.
<p>

<dt>(winoffsetx = 0.0) [real]

<dd>The value of the windowing offset parameter in the X-direction, 
which is required  when the 
teldef file contains a 'TRTYPEn = MULTISEG' transformation.   The value is used,
along with the multisegpar parameters to determine the formula for the
MULTISEG transformation.  Since it is an additive parameter in the transformation
formula, when 'winoffsetx=0' (DEFAULT) the parameter is effectively ignored.    
<p>

<dt>(winoffsety = 0.0) [real]

<dd>The value of the windowing offset parameter in the Y-direction, 
which is required  when the 
teldef file contains a 'TRTYPEn = MULTISEG' transformation.   The value is used,
along with the multisegpar parameters to determine the formula for the
MULTISEG transformation.  Since it is an additive parameter in the transformation
formula, when 'winoffsety=0' (DEFAULT) the parameter is effectively ignored.    
<p>

<dt>(outx = 0.0) [real]

<dd>(Output parameter) 
The value of the output X coordinate when the input is a coordinate point or
pixel number.  This number is also written to stdout. When 'stopsys' is the lowest 
level coordinate system and pixel numbers defines that 
system, 'outx' represents the pixel number and 'outy' is set to zero. 
This parameter is set to 0.0 (DEFAULT) when the input is a region file.     
<p>

<dt>(outy = 0.0) [real]

<dd>(Output parameter) 
The value of the output Y coordinate when the input is a coordinate point or
pixel number.  This number is also written to stdout.   When 'stopsys' is
the lowest level coordinate system and that system is defined by pixel numbers,
'outy' is set to zero and 'outx' represents the pixel number.
This parameter is set to 0.0 (DEFAULT) when the input is a region file.     
<p>


<p>
<dt>(clobber = no) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Overwrites the existing output file if set to yes (yes/[no]). </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer] </dt>
<dd>Chatter level for output. Set to 0 to suppress output,
or to 1, 2, or 3 for increasing the chatter of the output. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(logfile = !DEFAULT) [string]</dt>
<dd>Log filename. If set to DEFAULT uses the name of the task and, if
preceded by '!', overwrite the file if it exists. If set to NONE no
log file is created. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(debug = no) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Diagnostic output is printed out on the screen if set to yes
(yes/[no]).</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(history = yes) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Records tool parameters in HISTORY  ([yes]/no).</dd>
<p>

<dt>(mode = ql) [string]</dt>
<dd>Mode to query the parameter file.
Acceptable values include: "ql (query and learn/remember), "hl" (hidden and learn/remember), "q" (query but don't remember), "h" (hidden). </dd>
