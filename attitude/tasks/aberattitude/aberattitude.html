<h2>NAME</h2>

aberattitude - Correct an attitude file for aberration effects

<h2>USAGE</h2>

<tt> aberattitude infile outfile </tt>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

'aberattitude' is a mission-independent tool, which modifies
an attitude file to correct for aberration effects. 
The task requires an attitude input file (parameter 'infile') and 
computes the correction for each 
unique time present in this input file. The output file, specified by 
the parameter 'outfile' contains the corrected attitude columns along the 
original ones renamed with the string '_OLD' appended. For example, for 
an  input file with a 'QPARAM' attitude column, the output file has a 
column named 'QPARAM_OLD' containing the original values and a column named
'QPARAM' containing the corrected values. 

<p>
The aberration of light (also referred to as stellar aberration) 
is a phenomenon which produces an 
apparent motion of celestial objects about their locations 
dependent on the velocity of the observer.

<p>
If the parameter 'debug' is set to 'yes',
the following quantities are printed for each row of the input table: 'TIME',
mission time; 'VTOT', total spacecraft velocity; 
'VSATX', 'VSATY', and 'VSATZ', X, Y and Z components of the total
satellite velocity; 'VEARTH', Earth velocity; 'VEARTHX', 'VEARTHY', and 'VEARTHZ',
X, Y and Z components of the Earth velocity; 'ERADVEL', projection
of Earth velocity onto unit vector toward the observed target.
The (X, Y, Z) system is a right-handed
Equatorial system where X points toward the Vernal Equinox and Z toward
the North Celestial Pole.  Velocity unit is km/s.

<p>
<h2>PARAMETERS</h2>
<dl>

<dt>infile [filename]
<dd>Name of the input attitude file.
<p>

<dt>outfile [filename]
<dd>Name of the output attitude file.
<p>

<dt>(orbfile = NONE) [filename]
<dd>Name of the orbit file used to retrieve spacecraft velocity in 
Earth-Centered
Inertial (ECI) Cartesian coordinates.  This file is required only if 
'orbaber=yes'.
<p>

<dt>(alignfile = NONE) [filename]
<dd>Name of the spacecraft alignment calibration file. The alignment file 
specifies the
rotation between the telescope and spacecraft axes.
<p>

<dt>(annaber = yes) [string]
<dd>
'annaber' allows to correct for annual aberration. 
The allowed setting are yes, no or invert. 
If set to no, the default, no correction is applied. 
If set to yes, the effects
of annual aberration are taken into account when calculating the SKY 
coordinate values. 
If set to invert, 
multiplies the annual
aberration correction by -1 before applying it. 
The 'invert' option is only used for debugging. 
Annual aberration is the apparent bending
of light due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. This is at most a ~20.49 
arcsec effect. 
</dd> 
<p>


<dt>(orbaber = no) [string]
<dd>
'orbaber' allows to correct for orbital aberration. 
The allowed setting are yes, no or invert. 
If set to no, the default, the orbital aberration is not corrected.
If set to yes, the effects of orbital aberration are taken into account when 
calculating the SKY coordinates, provided an input orbit file is specified 
using the 
parameter 'orbfile'. 
 If set to 'invert', multiplies 
the orbital
aberration correction by -1 before applying it. 
The 'invert' option is only used for debugging.  
Orbital aberration is the apparent
bending of light due to the satellite's orbit around the Earth. For a satellite
in low-earth orbit this is at most a ~5 arcsec effect. 
</dd>
<p>


<dt>(attext = ATTITUDE) [string]
<dd>Name of the FITS binary table extension of the input attitude file
containing the attitude to be corrected.
<p> The attitude in the input file can be in one of three following formats 
specified by the parameter 'attform' (see below).   
<dl>
<dt> 1. attform=QUAT: Quaternion [x, y, z, real] 
<dt> 2. attform=EULER: Z-Y-Z Euler angles (phi, theta, psi) in degrees.  
<dt> 3. attform=POINTING: Pointing angles (right ascension, declination, 
roll) in degrees. 
</dl>
If the attitude file contains separate columns giving the attitude 
in more than one
format, only the column formatted as specified with the 'attform'  parameter 
is corrected.

<p>

<dt>(attcol = QPARAM) [string]
<dd>Name of the column in the input attitude file containing the attitude to 
be corrected.  The data in this column must be in the format given
by the 'attform'  parameter.
<dd>

<p>
<dt>(attform = QUAT) [string]
<dd>Format of the attitude table.
Three formats are supported. The QUAT format is a quaternion [x, y, z, real]. 
The
EULER format is a Z-Y-Z Euler angle trio [phi, theta, psi] in degrees and the 
POINTING format. </dd>
<p>

<p>
<dt>(orbext = ORBIT) [string]
<dd>Name of the FITS binary table extension of the orbit file
containing the velocity vectors.
<p>

<dt>(orbcol = VELOCITY) [string]
<dd>Name(s) of the
FITS column(s) containing orbit values in the orbext
extension of the orbit file. This parameter is linked to the parameter 
'orbform'. 
The only acceptable values for 'orbcol' are: VELOCITY, VECTOR or
COMPONENTS. The default is 'VELOCITY'. 
If 'orbform=VECTOR', then 'orbcol' is the name of the single FITS
column containing the orbit values as a vector. 
If 'orbform=COMPONENTS', then 'orbcol' must be a string containing three
comma-separated column names, specifying in order the X, Y and Z components of
the orbital velocity. These columns must be scalar. Velocity must be in km/s 
in an 
Earth-Centered Inertial system. </dd>
<p>



<dt>(orbform = VECTOR) [string]
<dd>Format of the orbital velocity column or columns in the orbit file.
Three formats are supported. For the VECTOR format (DEFAULT), the velocity is 
provided as a
vector column with three elements (X, Y and Z in Earth-Centered Inertial (ECI)
system). For the COMPONENT format, the velocity is provided in three separate
columns. 
<dd>

<p>
<dt>(buffer = -1) [integer] </dt>
<dd> Rows to buffer (-1=auto, 0=none, >0=numrows). </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(clobber = no) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Overwrites the existing output file if set to yes (yes/[no]). </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(chatter = 1) [integer] </dt>
<dd>Chatter level for output. Set to 0 to suppress output,
or to 1, 2, or 3 for increasing the chatter of the output. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(logfile = !DEFAULT) [string]</dt>
<dd>Log filename. If set to DEFAULT uses the name of the task and, if
preceded by '!', overwrite the file if it exists. If set to NONE no
log file is created. </dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(debug = no) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Diagnostic output is printed out on the screen if set to yes
(yes/[no]).</dd>
</p>

<p>
<dt>(history = yes) [boolean]</dt>
<dd>Records tool parameters in HISTORY  ([yes]/no).</dd>
<p>

<dt>(mode = ql) [string ql|hl|q]</dt>
<dd>Mode to query the parameter file.
Acceptable values include: "ql (query and learn/remember), "hl" (hidden and 
learn/remember), "q" (query but don't remember), "h" (hidden). </dd>
