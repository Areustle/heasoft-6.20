Configuration Management and HEAdas Setup.</A>
</H1>

<P>
All configuration management of HEAdas will be handled by the
HEASARC, including such things as Makefiles and configure
scripts. Code revision control will be handled via a central CVS
repository resident on HEASARC servers. Developers of
mission-specific software will only have write access in the
relevant portions of the repository but will have read access to the
entire package so that they can check-out as much of it as they
wish for local testing. However, a limited number of HEASARC
programmers will have global write access to enable necessary
configuration modifications. CVS includes automatic email
notification of new check-ins so that developers will be informed
of any changes to their portion of the repository as they occur.

<P>
The directory structure for any given subpackage will be
reasonably flexible so that mission software developers can
arrange things to suit their own needs and/or preferences. Certain
constraints may, however, be required to accomodate the overall
HEAdas build paradigm.

<P>
Full, top-down builds are started from the headas/BUILD_DIR
directory using the typical steps of ./configure followed by make
and then finally make install. Internally, however, builds will be
managed by hmake, exactly as in the current FTOOLS package.
This utility is designed to also make it easy to build all or part of the
distribution on any supported platform without having to make
modifications by hand specifying the location and/or names of
necessary flags and libraries. That is, once a full build and install
have been performed, a developer may simply checkout a copy of
a particular tool and build it via the command hmake. Before using
hmake (assuming a cshell environment) one simply needs to
source the file $HEADAS/BUILD_DIR/hdevinit.csh, where
$HEADAS is the environment variable which points to the location of
the relevant HEAdas installation, eg,
/usr/local/src/headas/i686-pc-linux-gnu. Similarly, to set
oneself up to use installed HEAdas tasks one would source
$HEADAS/headas-init.csh. Note that Bourne shell/bash variants
are also provided for people who prefer those shell environments.
These are identical except that the file suffixes are .sh instead of
.csh and they would, of course, be invoked according to the usual
shell syntax.

<P>
NOTE: For the time being the hmake utility from a HEASoft
installation is NOT interchangable with the one from a HEAdas
installation. This is currently being revised and ultimately it will not
matter which version comes first in one's search path. Until then,
caveat developer...
