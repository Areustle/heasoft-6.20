fpack, a FITS tile-compression engine.  Version 1.1.2 (September 2008)

usage: fpack [-r|-h|-g|-p] [-w|-t <axes>] [-q <level>] [-s <scale>] [-n <noise>] -v <FITS>
more:   [-T] [-F] [-D] [-Y] [-S] [-L] [-C] [-H] [-V]

Flags must be separate and appear before filenames:
   -r          Rice compression [default], or
   -h          Hcompress compression, or
   -g          GZIP (per-tile) compression, or
   -p          PLIO compression (only for positive 8 or 16-bit integer images)
   -d          tile the image without compression (debugging mode)
   -w          compress the whole image,as a single large tile
   -t <axes>   comma separated list of tile dimensions [default=row by row]
   -q <level>  quantization level for floating point images [default=16]
               (+values relative to RMS noise; -value is absolute)
   -s <scale>  scale factor for lossy Hcompress [default = 0 = lossless]
               (+values relative to RMS noise; -value is absolute)
   -n <noise>  rescale scaled-integer images to reduce noise
   -v          verbose mode; list each file as it is processed
   -T          print test comparison report of compression algorithms
   -R <file>   write test report results to text file

keywords shared with funpack:
   -F          overwrite input file by output file with same name
   -D          delete input file after writing output
   -Y          suppress prompts to confirm -F or -D options
   -S          output compressed FITS files to STDOUT
   -L          list contents, files unchanged
   -C          don't update FITS checksum keywords
   -H          print this message
   -V          print version number
 <FITS>        FITS files to pack
