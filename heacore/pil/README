Authors:        Jerzy.Borkowski@obs.unige.ch (JB)

History: 

06-Oct-97 (JB):	support for command line arguments added

10-May-98 (JB):	PILGetReal4 function added 

13-May-98 (JB):	version 0.7 released. Code cleanup, unnecesary dependencies 
		removed. Uses/links only PIL library. Changes to Makefile.

13-Aug-98 (JB):	version 1.0 released. More compatible with Common library 
		some new functions: PILReloadParameters, PILFlushParameters, 
		locking of parameter file during read/write implemented.

17-Aug-98 (JB):	reformatted, more comments added

25-Aug-98 (JB):	undefined flock_t bug fixed (linux, osf)

01-Feb-99 (JB): version 1.1 released, several bugfixes (mostly to make it more 
		portable to other architectures, this includes also Makefiles
		update.

19-Mar-99 (JB):	version 1.2 released. New set of Makefiles (version 1.0) is 
		now used. Also READMEs/*.html/*.ps documentation files updated.
		Postscript manual. Several changes to F90 code to make it
		independent from other packages, ISDC_OK multiply defined 
		problem solved, IMPLICIT NONE used throughout all source
		code. Manual moved to doc directory to make it more CTS
		compliant.

26-May-99 (JB):	updated to Makefiles-1.1.2. Support for new dir structure

25-Jun-99 (JB): added "" -> empty string substitution.
		added vector parameters support (3 new API functions)

04-Aug-99 (JB): updated makeisdc1.in. Now install installs f90_unix.mod
		and cfortran.h and cfortran_isdc.h. No changes to code.
		Updates were necessary to facilitate integration with
		global makefile. Version changed to 1.3.1. Documentation
		however references version 1.3 (since no changes to code)

08-Dec-99 (JB): fixed problem with modification time comparison between user
		and system parameter files (if both are present)

27-Jan-00 (JB):	version 1.4 released. Added const to char * where necessary.
		upgraded to new makefiles 2.0.1

04-Feb-00 (JB):	PILGetNumParameters/PILGetParameter added to API, version 
		1.4.1 released

23-Feb-00 (JB):	version 1.4.3 released, fixes in PIL_build_names().

06-Mar-00 (JB): version 1.4.4, bugfix in F90 code - error codes are now in
		line with C code.

17-Jul-00 (JB): version 1.4.5, subtle bugfix in PIL_verify_access(). When
		checking whether one can create new file with fopen("w"),
		if fopen() was successful, file was not removed. This was
		causing 0 length parameter files if PFILES was undefined and
		there was no .par file in current directory.

27-Sep-00 (JB): version 1.5.1, NUL PTR bugfixes in xxxget/xxxput. Also
		PILVerifyCmdLine() added. xxxVarVector() added
		PILLastNotFoundName variable added, pil_lint executable
		added, pil_gen_c_code executable added

31-Oct-00 (JB): version 1.6.0, new syntax: ${env.name} is now expanded.
		Multiple ${..} are allowed in argument value/min/max.
		To disable ${...} expansion put '}' in pil_ext_indir
		parameter in the parameter file. The detailed syntax is :

   1) any ${xyz} is expanded to the value of xyz environment variable. 
      If xyz is empty string then ${} is replaced by an empty string.
   2) ${xyz} can appear many times and at any location.
   3) any other char string is passed verbatim to the caller.

		For instance :

			${HOME}/.cshrc

		is expanded to the :

			/home/isdc/your_login_name/.cshrc

		When updating values in parameter file expansions are
		disabled. So if you enter ${HOME}/.cshrc this value
		is written to the parameter file.

01-Nov-00 (JB): version 1.6.1, bugfix in curly_expand (when string default
		value in parfile is "")

15-Jan-01 (JB): version 1.6.2, implementation of SPR 165

09-Feb-01 (JB): version 1.6.3, SCREW 149 implemented (enumerated values).
		PILGetString() returns UPPERCASE values if parameter has
		enum list. GetGetFname/Int/Real/etc.. return entered string.
		Also PILGetString compares entered value ignoring case.
		Users Manual brought up to date.

03-Jul-01 (JB):	version 1.7.1, SCREW 255, SCREW 289, SPR 479

14-Aug-01 (JB): version 1.7.2, SPR 479 implementation in 1.7.1 was incorrect
		This also fixes related SPR 0559

27-Aug-01 (JB): version 1.7.3. SPR 00649

08-Mar-02 (JB): version 1.8.0, fixes in trim_spaces, added root_name
		support, fixes in flush_params, reload_params and handling
		of the default mode (bugs were reported by James Peachey
		(peachey@bigband.gsfc.nasa.gov) and Bill Pence
		(pence@tetra.gsfc.nasa.gov), also implemented SPR 1050

03-Apr-02 (JB): version 1.8.1-beta, SPR 1153 implemented, Also 2 extra modes for
		better compatibility with other software :

		1) special READLINE mode : edit buffer is initially set to
		the default value. Pressing ENTER accepts default value (as
		before). However, pressing Ctrl-W (or DEL/BACKSPACE several
		times, or Ctrl-A, then Ctrl-K) allows empty string to be 
		returned without setenv PIL_EMPTY_STRING or similar tricks.
		This mode is set by calling 
			PILSetReadlinePromptMode(PIL_RL_PROMPT_IEB)
		or by compiling library with STARTUP_PIL_RL_PROMPT_IEB
		defined. Note that default value is _NOT_ printed inside
		square brackets before ':' character anymore.

		2) special cmndline args mode : When this mode is in effect
		the command line arguments must be given using the following
		syntax :

			/path/program_name  name1 = value1 name2 = value2 [...]

		This mode is set by calling PILSetCmndArgMode(PIL_CMNDARG_NSESA)
		or by compiling library with STARTUP_PIL_CMNDARG_NSESA defined.

19-Apr-02 (JB):	version 1.8.1, SPR 01153, SCREW 00507
		To user new logging facility applications should call (for
		instance in CommonInit()) :

			PILInit(....);
			PILSetLoggerFunction(custom_logger);

		and the custom_logger() could be :

		int custom_logger(char *s)
		  {
		    RILlogMessage(NULL, Error_2, s);
		    return(0);
		  }
06-May-02 (MT/BP/JP): version 1.8.2, incorporated 3 fixes submitted by Mike Tripicco,
		Bill Pence and James Peachey.
08-May-02 (JB): implemented SPR 00687, SCREW 00370, 00505, this means that
		pget/pset/plist/pil_lint/pil_gen_c_code moved to new package :
		pil_tools, furthermode pget -> pil_get, pset -> pil_set, plist
		-> pil_list (but also temporarily there's a link with old name)
		PIL_LINT_MODE implemented, so that pil_lint is much more paranoid
		about parameter file syntax.
20-May-02 (JB) : reverted some changes made in version 1.8.2 (SPR 1367)

30-May-02 (JB) : reverted even more changes made in version 1.8.2/3 (SPR 1442)

19-Sep-02 (JB) : SCREW 00532 - better support for MacOSX, SPR 1618 - read from uninit.
		SPR 1918 - more specific error messages

18-nov-02 (JB) : SPR 2282 : do not rewrite parameter file if not really	necessary

18-dec-02 (JB) : SPR 02433 : better support for ISDCroot and the like ....

27-Feb-2003(JB): SCREW 01078 : truncate to length 1, not to 0

22-May-2003 (JP) : version 1.9.0, Windows_xxxx port

05-Jun-2003 (JB) : version 1.9.1, SPR 03023

02-Oct-2003 (JP) : version 1.9.2. SPR 2592: allow quotes in strings.
		SPR 3169: new way of handling multi-process access to
		parameter files. SPR 3214: distclean should not remove
		Makefile, etc.

16-Jan-2004 (JP) : version 1.9.3. SCREW 1326: every component should identify
		its version. SPR 3302: fix an uninitialized memory read error.
		SPR 3410: error message for a file not found should be more
		comprehensible.

03-Feb-2004 (JP) : version 1.9.4. SPR 3454: some #ifdefed constructs used
		for Windows support cause problems for Cint, so use an
		additional level of #ifdefs to keep Cint happy.

29-Apr-2004 (JP) : version 1.9.5. SPR 3548: parameter file merging as
		implemented in version 1.9.1 did not correctly write
		learned parameters which did not change if others did
		change. SPR 3448: Make format correct for unsigned long.

29-Apr-2004 (JP) : version 1.9.6. SPR 3580: make sure input buffer is
		terminated with 0.
